**Cue-1a THE CENTURION.**
(_scandalised_) Silence! (Captain enters)

**THE CAPTAIN**
Centurion.

**Cue-1b THE CENTURION.**
(_standing at attention and saluting_) Sir?

**THE CAPTAIN**
(_speaking stiffly and officially_) You will remind your men,
Centurion, that we are now entering Rome. You will instruct them that
once inside the gates of Rome they are in the presence of the Emperor.
You will make them understand that the lax discipline of the march
cannot be permitted here. You will instruct them to shave every day,
not every week. You will impress on them particularly that there must
be an end to the profanity and blasphemy of singing Christian hymns on
the march. I have to reprimand you, Centurion, for not only allowing
this, but actually doing it yourself.

**Cue-1c THE CENTURION.**
The men march better, Captain.

**THE CAPTAIN**
No doubt. For that reason an exception is made in the case of the march
called Onward Christian Soldiers. This may be sung, except when
marching through the forum or within hearing of the Emperor’s palace;
but the words must be altered to “Throw them to the Lions.”

...
**Cue-1d THE CENTURION**
(_To the Christians_) Silence!

**THE CAPTAIN**
You are to instruct your men that all intimacy with Christian prisoners
must now cease. The men have fallen into habits of dependence upon the
prisoners, especially the female prisoners, for cooking, repairs to
uniforms, writing letters, and advice in their private affairs. In a
Roman soldier such dependence is inadmissible. Let me see no more of it
whilst we are in the city. Further, your orders are that in addressing
Christian prisoners, the manners and tone of your men must express
abhorrence and contempt. Any shortcoming in this respect will be
regarded as a breach of discipline. (_He turns to the prisoners_)
Prisoners.
