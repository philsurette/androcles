**THE CAPTAIN**(_He turns to the prisoners_)
Prisoners.

**Cue-CENTURION.**
(_fiercely_) Prisonerrrrrs! Tention! Silence!

**THE CAPTAIN**
I call your attention, prisoners, to the fact that you may be called on
to appear in the Imperial Circus at any time from tomorrow onwards
according to the requirements of the managers. I may inform you that as
there is a shortage of Christians just now, you may expect to be called
on very soon.

LAVINIA.
What will they do to us, Captain?

**Cue-CENTURION.**
Silence!

**THE CAPTAIN**
The women will be conducted into the arena with the wild beasts of the
Imperial Menagerie, and will suffer the consequences. The men, if of an
age to bear arms, will be given weapons to defend themselves, if they
choose, against the Imperial Gladiators.

LAVINIA.
Captain: is there no hope that this cruel persecution—

**Cue-CENTURION.**
(_shocked_) Silence! Hold your tongue, there. Persecution, indeed!

**THE CAPTAIN**
(_unmoved and somewhat sardonic_) Persecution is not a term applicable
to the acts of the Emperor. The Emperor is the Defender of the Faith.
In throwing you to the lions he will be upholding the interests of
religion in Rome. If you were to throw him to the lions, that would no
doubt be persecution.

_The Christians again laugh heartily._

CENTURION.
(_horrified_) Silence, I tell you! Keep silence there. Did anyone ever
hear the like of this?

**Cue-LAVINIA.**
Captain: there will be nobody to appreciate your jokes when we are
gone.

**THE CAPTAIN**
(_unshaken in his official delivery_) I call the attention of the
female prisoner Lavinia to the fact that as the Emperor is a divine
personage, her imputation of cruelty is not only treason, but
sacrilege. I point out to her further that there is no foundation for
the charge, as the Emperor does not desire that any prisoner should
suffer; nor can any Christian be harmed save through his or her own
obstinacy. All that is necessary is to sacrifice to the gods: a simple
and convenient ceremony effected by dropping a pinch of incense on the
altar, after which the prisoner is at once set free. Under such
circumstances you have only your own perverse folly to blame if you
suffer. I suggest to you that if you cannot burn a morsel of incense as
a matter of conviction, you might at least do so as a matter of good
taste, to avoid shocking the religious convictions of your fellow
citizens. I am aware that these considerations do not weigh with
Christians; but it is my duty to call your attention to them in order
that you may have no ground for complaining of your treatment, or of
accusing the Emperor of cruelty when he is showing you the most signal
clemency. Looked at from this point of view, every Christian who has
perished in the arena has really committed suicide.

**Cue-LAVINIA**
the martyr’s agony is as bitter as his triumph is glorious.

**THE CAPTAIN**
(_rather troubled, addressing her personally and gravely_) A martyr,
Lavinia, is a fool. Your death will prove nothing.

**Cue-LAVINIA.**
Then why kill me?

**THE CAPTAIN**
I mean that truth, if there be any truth, needs no martyrs.

**Cue-LAVINIA.**
No; but my faith, like your sword, needs testing. Can you test your
sword except by staking your life on it?

**THE CAPTAIN**
(_suddenly resuming his official tone_) I call the attention of the
female prisoner to the fact that Christians are not allowed to draw the
Emperor’s officers into arguments and put questions to them for which
the military regulations provide no answer. (_The Christians titter_).

**Cue-LAVINIA.**
Captain: how CAN you?

**THE CAPTAIN**
I call the female prisoner’s attention specially to the fact that four
comfortable homes have been offered her by officers of this regiment,
of which she can have her choice the moment she chooses to sacrifice as
all well-bred Roman ladies do. I have no more to say to the prisoners.
