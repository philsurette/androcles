**Cue-CENTURION.**
Dismiss! But stay where you are.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Centurion: you will remain here with your men in charge of the
prisoners until the arrival of three Christian prisoners in the custody
of a cohort of the tenth legion. Among these prisoners you will
particularly identify an armorer named Ferrovius, of dangerous
character and great personal strength, and a Greek tailor reputed to be
a sorcerer, by name Androcles. You will add the three to your charge
here and march them all to the Coliseum, where you will deliver them
into the custody of the master of the gladiators and take his receipt,
countersigned by the keeper of the beasts and the acting manager. You
understand your instructions?

**Cue-CENTURION.**
Yes, Sir.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Dismiss. (_He throws off his air of parade, and descends down from the
perch. The Centurion seats on it and prepares for a nap, whilst his men
stand at ease. The Christians sit down on the west side of the square,
glad to rest. Lavinia alone remains standing to speak to the Captain_).

**Cue-LAVINIA.**
Captain: is this man who is to join us the famous Ferrovius, who has
made such wonderful conversions in the northern cities?

**THE CAPTAIN**
Yes. We are warned that he has the strength of an elephant and the
temper of a mad bull. Also that he is stark mad. Not a model Christian,
it would seem.

**Cue-LAVINIA.**
You need not fear him if he is a Christian, Captain.

**THE CAPTAIN**
(_coldly_) I shall not fear him in any case, Lavinia.

**Cue-LAVINIA.**
(_her eyes dancing_) How brave of you, Captain!

**THE CAPTAIN**
You are right: it was silly thing to say. (_In a lower tone, humane and
urgent_) Lavinia: do Christians know how to love?

**Cue-LAVINIA.**
(_composedly_) Yes, Captain: they love even their enemies.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Is that easy?

**Cue-LAVINIA.**
Very easy, Captain, when their enemies are as handsome as you.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Lavinia: you are laughing at me.

**Cue-LAVINIA.**
At you, Captain! Impossible.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Then you are flirting with me, which is worse. Don’t be foolish.

**Cue-LAVINIA.**
But such a very handsome captain.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Incorrigible! (_Urgently_) Listen to me. The men in that audience
tomorrow will be the vilest of voluptuaries: men in whom the only
passion excited by a beautiful woman is a lust to see her tortured and
torn shrieking limb from limb. It is a crime to dignify that passion.
It is offering yourself for violation by the whole rabble of the
streets and the riff-raff of the court at the same time. Why will you
not choose rather a kindly love and an honorable alliance?

**Cue-LAVINIA.**
They cannot violate my soul. I alone can do that by sacrificing to
false gods.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Sacrifice then to the true God. What does his name matter? We call him
Jupiter. The Greeks call him Zeus. Call him what you will as you drop
the incense on the altar flame: He will understand.

**Cue-LAVINIA.**
...Can you understand that?

**THE CAPTAIN**
(_simply_) Yes: I understand that. But my hand would not come back. The
hand that holds the sword has been trained not to come back from
anything but victory.

**Cue-LAVINIA.**
Not even from death?

**THE CAPTAIN**
Least of all from death.

**Cue-LAVINIA.**
Then I must not come back either. A woman has to be braver than a
soldier.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Prouder, you mean.

**Cue-LAVINIA.**
(_startled_) Prouder! You call our courage pride!

**THE CAPTAIN**
There is no such thing as courage: there is only pride. You Christians
are the proudest devils on earth.

**Cue-LAVINIA**
...Thank you for trying to save me from death.

**THE CAPTAIN**
I knew it was no use; but one tries in spite of one’s knowledge.

**Cue-LAVINIA.**
Something stirs, even in the iron breast of a Roman soldier!

**THE CAPTAIN**
It will soon be iron again. I have seen many women die, and forgotten
them in a week.

**Cue-LAVINIA.**
Remember me for a fortnight, handsome Captain. I shall be watching you,
perhaps.

**THE CAPTAIN**
From the skies? Do not deceive yourself, Lavinia. There is no future
for you beyond the grave.

**Cue-LAVINIA.**
...The hand of God is upon me.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Yes: when all is said, we are both patricians, Lavinia, and must die
for our beliefs. Farewell.
