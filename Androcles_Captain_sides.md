## ACT I — Outside the gates of Rome (square by the Coliseum)

(_The Captain arrives_). 
**CENTURION** Attention! Salute! 
(_The soldiers salute_).

**A CHRISTIAN** (_cheerfully_) God bless you, Captain.

**THE CENTURION** (_scandalised_) Silence!

> **Cue - Narration** _The Captain, a patrician, handsome, about thirty-five, very cold and
distinguished, very superior and authoritative, steps up on a stone
seat at the west side of the square, behind the centurion, so as to
dominate the others more effectually._

**CAPTAIN:** Centurion.

> **Cue — CENTURION:** (standing at attention and saluting) Sir?  

> **Cue — Narration:** The Captain ascends and addresses the Centurion and men.  
**CAPTAIN:** (speaking stiffly and officially) You will remind your men,
Centurion, that we are now entering Rome. You will instruct them that
once inside the gates of Rome they are in the presence of the Emperor.
You will make them understand that the lax discipline of the march
cannot be permitted here. You will instruct them to shave every day,
not every week. You will impress on them particularly that there must
be an end to the profanity and blasphemy of singing Christian hymns on
the march. I have to reprimand you, Centurion, for not only allowing
this, but actually doing it yourself.

> **Cue — CENTURION:** The men march better, Captain.  
**CAPTAIN:** No doubt. For that reason an exception is made in the case of the march called Onward Christian Soldiers. This may be sung, except when marching through the forum or within hearing of the Emperor’s palace; but the words must be altered to “Throw them to the Lions.”

_The Christians burst into shrieks of uncontrollable laughter, to the
great scandal of the Centurion._

CENTURION.
Silence! Silen-n-n-n-nce! Where’s your behavior? Is that the way to
listen to an officer? (_To the Captain_) That’s what we have to put up
with from these Christians every day, sir. They’re always laughing and
joking something scandalous. They’ve no religion: that’s how it is.

LAVINIA.
But I think the Captain meant us to laugh, Centurion. It was so funny.

CENTURION.
You’ll find out how funny it is when you’re thrown to the lions
to-morrow. (_To the Captain, who looks displeased_) Beg pardon, Sir.
> **Cue — CENTURION:** Silennnnce!  
**CAPTAIN:** You are to instruct your men that all intimacy with Christian prisoners
must now cease. The men have fallen into habits of dependence upon the
prisoners, especially the female prisoners, for cooking, repairs to
uniforms, writing letters, and advice in their private affairs. In a
Roman soldier such dependence is inadmissible. Let me see no more of it
whilst we are in the city. Further, your orders are that in addressing
Christian prisoners, the manners and tone of your men must express
abhorrence and contempt. Any shortcoming in this respect will be
regarded as a breach of discipline. (_He turns to the prisoners_)
Prisoners.

> **Cue — CENTURION** (_fiercely_) Prisonerrrrrs! Tention! Silence! 
**CAPTAIN:** I call your attention, prisoners, to the fact that you may be called on to appear in the Imperial Circus at any time from tomorrow onwards according to the requirements of the managers. I may inform you that as there is a shortage of Christians just now, you may expect to be called on very soon.

> **Cue — LAVINIA:** What will they do to us, Captain?  
**CAPTAIN:** The women will be conducted into the arena with the wild beasts of the Imperial Menagerie, and will suffer the consequences. The men, if of an age to bear arms, will be given weapons to defend themselves, if they choose, against the Imperial Gladiators.

LAVINIA.
What will they do to us, Captain?

> **Cue - CENTURION** Silence!
**THE CAPTAIN**
The women will be conducted into the arena with the wild beasts of the
Imperial Menagerie, and will suffer the consequences. The men, if of an
age to bear arms, will be given weapons to defend themselves, if they
choose, against the Imperial Gladiators.
