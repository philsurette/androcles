**Cue-1 THE CENTURION.**
(_scandalised_) Silence! (Captain enters)

**THE CAPTAIN**
Centurion.

**Cue-2 THE CENTURION.**
(_standing at attention and saluting_) Sir?

**THE CAPTAIN**
(_speaking stiffly and officially_) You will remind your men,
Centurion, that we are now entering Rome. You will instruct them that
once inside the gates of Rome they are in the presence of the Emperor.
You will make them understand that the lax discipline of the march
cannot be permitted here. You will instruct them to shave every day,
not every week. You will impress on them particularly that there must
be an end to the profanity and blasphemy of singing Christian hymns on
the march. I have to reprimand you, Centurion, for not only allowing
this, but actually doing it yourself.

**Cue-3 THE CENTURION.**
The men march better, Captain.

**THE CAPTAIN**
No doubt. For that reason an exception is made in the case of the march
called Onward Christian Soldiers. This may be sung, except when
marching through the forum or within hearing of the Emperor’s palace;
but the words must be altered to “Throw them to the Lions.”

...
**Cue-4 THE CENTURION**
(_To the Christians_) Silence!

**THE CAPTAIN**
You are to instruct your men that all intimacy with Christian prisoners
must now cease. The men have fallen into habits of dependence upon the
prisoners, especially the female prisoners, for cooking, repairs to
uniforms, writing letters, and advice in their private affairs. In a
Roman soldier such dependence is inadmissible. Let me see no more of it
whilst we are in the city. Further, your orders are that in addressing
Christian prisoners, the manners and tone of your men must express
abhorrence and contempt. Any shortcoming in this respect will be
regarded as a breach of discipline. (_He turns to the prisoners_)
Prisoners.

**Cue-5 CENTURION.**
(_fiercely_) Prisonerrrrrs! Tention! Silence!

**THE CAPTAIN**
I call your attention, prisoners, to the fact that you may be called on
to appear in the Imperial Circus at any time from tomorrow onwards
according to the requirements of the managers. I may inform you that as
there is a shortage of Christians just now, you may expect to be called
on very soon.

**Cue 6-LAVINIA**.
What will they do to us, Captain?

**CENTURION.**
Silence!

**THE CAPTAIN**
The women will be conducted into the arena with the wild beasts of the
Imperial Menagerie, and will suffer the consequences. The men, if of an
age to bear arms, will be given weapons to defend themselves, if they
choose, against the Imperial Gladiators.

**Cue-7 LAVINIA**
Captain: is there no hope that this cruel persecution—

**Cue-CENTURION.**
(_shocked_) Silence! Hold your tongue, there. Persecution, indeed!

**THE CAPTAIN**
(_unmoved and somewhat sardonic_) Persecution is not a term applicable
to the acts of the Emperor. The Emperor is the Defender of the Faith.
In throwing you to the lions he will be upholding the interests of
religion in Rome. If you were to throw him to the lions, that would no
doubt be persecution.

**Cue-8 CENTURION**
(_horrified_) Silence, I tell you! Keep silence there. Did anyone ever
hear the like of this?

**LAVINIA.**
Captain: there will be nobody to appreciate your jokes when we are
gone.

**THE CAPTAIN**
(_unshaken in his official delivery_) I call the attention of the
female prisoner Lavinia to the fact that as the Emperor is a divine
personage, her imputation of cruelty is not only treason, but
sacrilege. I point out to her further that there is no foundation for
the charge, as the Emperor does not desire that any prisoner should
suffer; nor can any Christian be harmed save through his or her own
obstinacy. All that is necessary is to sacrifice to the gods: a simple
and convenient ceremony effected by dropping a pinch of incense on the
altar, after which the prisoner is at once set free. Under such
circumstances you have only your own perverse folly to blame if you
suffer. I suggest to you that if you cannot burn a morsel of incense as
a matter of conviction, you might at least do so as a matter of good
taste, to avoid shocking the religious convictions of your fellow
citizens. I am aware that these considerations do not weigh with
Christians; but it is my duty to call your attention to them in order
that you may have no ground for complaining of your treatment, or of
accusing the Emperor of cruelty when he is showing you the most signal
clemency. Looked at from this point of view, every Christian who has
perished in the arena has really committed suicide.

**Cue-9 LAVINIA**
the martyr’s agony is as bitter as his triumph is glorious.

**THE CAPTAIN**
(_rather troubled, addressing her personally and gravely_) A martyr,
Lavinia, is a fool. Your death will prove nothing.

**Cue-10 LAVINIA.**
Then why kill me?

**THE CAPTAIN**
I mean that truth, if there be any truth, needs no martyrs.

**Cue-11 LAVINIA.**
No; but my faith, like your sword, needs testing. Can you test your
sword except by staking your life on it?

**THE CAPTAIN**
(_suddenly resuming his official tone_) I call the attention of the
female prisoner to the fact that Christians are not allowed to draw the
Emperor’s officers into arguments and put questions to them for which
the military regulations provide no answer. (_The Christians titter_).

**Cue-12 LAVINIA.**
Captain: how CAN you?

**THE CAPTAIN**
I call the female prisoner’s attention specially to the fact that four
comfortable homes have been offered her by officers of this regiment,
of which she can have her choice the moment she chooses to sacrifice as
all well-bred Roman ladies do. I have no more to say to the prisoners.

**Cue-13 CENTURION.**
Dismiss! But stay where you are.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Centurion: you will remain here with your men in charge of the
prisoners until the arrival of three Christian prisoners in the custody
of a cohort of the tenth legion. Among these prisoners you will
particularly identify an armorer named Ferrovius, of dangerous
character and great personal strength, and a Greek tailor reputed to be
a sorcerer, by name Androcles. You will add the three to your charge
here and march them all to the Coliseum, where you will deliver them
into the custody of the master of the gladiators and take his receipt,
countersigned by the keeper of the beasts and the acting manager. You
understand your instructions?

**Cue-14 CENTURION.**
Yes, Sir.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Dismiss. (_He throws off his air of parade, and descends down from the
perch. The Centurion seats on it and prepares for a nap, whilst his men
stand at ease. The Christians sit down on the west side of the square,
glad to rest. Lavinia alone remains standing to speak to the Captain_).

**Cue-15 LAVINIA.**
Captain: is this man who is to join us the famous Ferrovius, who has
made such wonderful conversions in the northern cities?

**THE CAPTAIN**
Yes. We are warned that he has the strength of an elephant and the
temper of a mad bull. Also that he is stark mad. Not a model Christian,
it would seem.

**Cue-16 LAVINIA.**
You need not fear him if he is a Christian, Captain.

**THE CAPTAIN**
(_coldly_) I shall not fear him in any case, Lavinia.

**Cue-17 LAVINIA.**
(_her eyes dancing_) How brave of you, Captain!

**THE CAPTAIN**
You are right: it was silly thing to say. (_In a lower tone, humane and
urgent_) Lavinia: do Christians know how to love?

**Cue-19 LAVINIA.**
(_composedly_) Yes, Captain: they love even their enemies.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Is that easy?

**Cue-20 LAVINIA.**
Very easy, Captain, when their enemies are as handsome as you.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Lavinia: you are laughing at me.

**Cue-21 LAVINIA.**
At you, Captain! Impossible.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Then you are flirting with me, which is worse. Don’t be foolish.

**Cue-22 LAVINIA.**
But such a very handsome captain.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Incorrigible! (_Urgently_) Listen to me. The men in that audience
tomorrow will be the vilest of voluptuaries: men in whom the only
passion excited by a beautiful woman is a lust to see her tortured and
torn shrieking limb from limb. It is a crime to dignify that passion.
It is offering yourself for violation by the whole rabble of the
streets and the riff-raff of the court at the same time. Why will you
not choose rather a kindly love and an honorable alliance?

**Cue-23 LAVINIA.**
They cannot violate my soul. I alone can do that by sacrificing to
false gods.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Sacrifice then to the true God. What does his name matter? We call him
Jupiter. The Greeks call him Zeus. Call him what you will as you drop
the incense on the altar flame: He will understand.

**Cue-24 LAVINIA.**
...Can you understand that?

**THE CAPTAIN**
(_simply_) Yes: I understand that. But my hand would not come back. The
hand that holds the sword has been trained not to come back from
anything but victory.

**Cue-25 LAVINIA.**
Not even from death?

**THE CAPTAIN**
Least of all from death.

**Cue-26 LAVINIA.**
Then I must not come back either. A woman has to be braver than a
soldier.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Prouder, you mean.

**Cue-27 LAVINIA.**
(_startled_) Prouder! You call our courage pride!

**THE CAPTAIN**
There is no such thing as courage: there is only pride. You Christians
are the proudest devils on earth.

**Cue-28 LAVINIA**
...Thank you for trying to save me from death.

**THE CAPTAIN**
I knew it was no use; but one tries in spite of one’s knowledge.

**Cue-29 LAVINIA.**
Something stirs, even in the iron breast of a Roman soldier!

**THE CAPTAIN**
It will soon be iron again. I have seen many women die, and forgotten
them in a week.

**Cue-30 LAVINIA.**
Remember me for a fortnight, handsome Captain. I shall be watching you,
perhaps.

**THE CAPTAIN**
From the skies? Do not deceive yourself, Lavinia. There is no future
for you beyond the grave.

**Cue-31 LAVINIA.**
...The hand of God is upon me.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Yes: when all is said, we are both patricians, Lavinia, and must die
for our beliefs. Farewell.
