**Cue-1 THE CALL BOY.**
In with you: into the arena. The stage is waiting.

**THE CAPTAIN**
The Emperor is waiting. (_To the Editor_) What are you dreaming of,
man? Send your men in at once.

...

**Cue-2 ANDROCLES.**
Don’t think of me, sister. Think of yourself. That will keep your heart
up.

**THE CAPTAIN**
_The Captain laughs sardonically._

**Cue-3 LAVINIA.**
(_startled: she had forgotten his presence_) Are you there, handsome
Captain? Have you come to see me die?

**THE CAPTAIN**
(_coming to her side_) I am on duty with the Emperor, Lavinia.

**Cue-4 LAVINIA.**
Is it part of your duty to laugh at us?

**THE CAPTAIN**
No: that is part of my private pleasure. Your friend here is a
humorist. I laughed at his telling you to think of yourself to keep up
your heart. I say, think of yourself and burn the incense.

**Cue-5 LAVINIA.**
He is not a humorist: he was right. You ought to know that, Captain:
you have been face to face with death.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Not with certain death, Lavinia. Only death in battle, which spares
more men than death in bed. What you are facing is certain death. You
have nothing left now but your faith in this craze of yours: this
Christianity. Are your Christian fairy stories any truer than our
stories about Jupiter and Diana, in which, I may tell you, I believe no
more than the Emperor does, or any educated man in Rome?

**Cue-6 LAVINIA.**
....Did you hear of the dreadful thing that happened here while we were waiting?

**THE CAPTAIN**
I heard that one of your fellows bolted, and ran right into the jaws of
the lion. I laughed. I still laugh.

**Cue-7 LAVINIA.**
Then you don’t understand what that meant?

**THE CAPTAIN**
It meant that the lion had a cur for his breakfast.

**Cue-8 LAVINIA.**
....with stories and dreams fading away into nothing.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Are you then going to die for nothing?

**Cue-9 LAVINIA.**
....I must die for something greater than dreams or stories.

**THE CAPTAIN**
But for what?

**Cue-10 LAVINIA.**
....Nothing else is real enough to die for.

**THE CAPTAIN**
What is God?

**Cue-11 LAVINIA.**
When we know that, Captain, we shall be gods ourselves.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Lavinia; come down to earth. Burn the incense and marry me.

**Cue-12 LAVINIA.**
....Do you want your son to be a coward?

**THE CAPTAIN**
(_strongly moved_). By great Diana, I think I would strangle you if you
gave in now.

**Cue-13 LAVINIA.**
(_putting her hand on the head of Androcles_) The hand of God is on us
three, Captain.

**THE CAPTAIN**
What nonsense it all is! And what a monstrous thing that you should die
for such nonsense, and that I should look on helplessly when my whole
soul cries out against it! Die then if you must; but at least I can cut
the Emperor’s throat and then my own when I see your blood.

....
**Cue-14 LAVINIA.**
(_to the Captain_) What has happened, do you think?

**THE CAPTAIN**
What CAN happen? They are killing them, I suppose.

...
**Cue-15 SLAVE.**
(_whistles three times_)

**THE CAPTAIN**
Who are the baskets for?

...
**Cue-16 RETIARIUS.** It is all one to us, Caesar. Had I been there with my net,
the story would have been different.

**THE CAPTAIN**
(_dragging Lavinia to the Emperor_) Caesar this woman is the sister of Ferrovius. If she
is thrown to the lions he will fret. He will lose weight; get out of
condition.

....
**Cue-17 FERROVIUS.**
(_looking at the lion_) It is strange that I, who fear no man, should fear a lion.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Every man fears something, Ferrovius.

THE EMPEROR.
**Cue-18 THE EMPEROR***
...but to make the best of both dispensations.

**THE CAPTAIN**
What do you say, Lavinia? Will you too be prudent?

**Cue-19 LAVINIA.**
(_on the stair_) No: I’ll strive for the coming of the God who is not
yet.

**THE CAPTAIN**
May I come and argue with you occasionally?

**Cue-20 LAVINIA.**
Yes, handsome Captain: you may. 

**THE CAPTAIN**
(_He kisses her hands_).
