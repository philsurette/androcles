# Voice Performance Quick Reference

## Male Voice
- Lightly tighten your belly for steady breath support.  
- Keep vibration low in the chest.  
- Speak closer to the mic (3–6 inches), slightly off to the side.  
- Use clear, firm vowel sounds (avoid breathy starts).  
- Keep the tone grounded and confident.

## Female Voice
- Relax your belly completely; no abdominal engagement.  
- Shift vibration forward into the face/mask area.  
- Add a touch of breathiness at the start of vowels.  
- Speak a little farther from the mic (6–10 inches).  
- Keep the tone lighter and smoother.  
- For shrewish characters: quicker pace, sharper consonants.  
- For dreamy characters: longer vowels, gentler rhythm.
