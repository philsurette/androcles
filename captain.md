ACT I


Evening. The end of three converging roads to Rome. Three triumphal
arches span them where they debouch on a square at the gate of the
city. Looking north through the arches one can see the campagna
threaded by the three long dusty tracks. On the east and west sides of
the square are long stone benches. An old beggar sits on the east side
of the square, his bowl at his feet. Through the eastern arch a squad
of Roman soldiers tramps along escorting a batch of Christian prisoners
of both sexes and all ages, among them one Lavinia, a goodlooking
resolute young woman, apparently of higher social standing than her
fellow-prisoners. A centurion, carrying his vinewood cudgel, trudges
alongside the squad, on its right, in command of it. All are tired and
dusty; but the soldiers are dogged and indifferent, the Christians
light-hearted and determined to treat their hardships as a joke and
encourage one another.

_A bugle is heard far behind on the road, where the rest of the cohort
is following._

CENTURION.
(_stopping_) Halt! Orders from the Captain. (_They halt and wait_). Now
then, you Christians, none of your larks. The captain’s coming. Mind
you behave yourselves. No singing. Look respectful. Look serious, if
you’re capable of it. See that big building over there? That’s the
Coliseum. That’s where you’ll be thrown to the lions or set to fight
the gladiators presently. Think of that; and it’ll help you to behave
properly before the captain. (_The Captain arrives_). Attention!
Salute! (_The soldiers salute_).

A CHRISTIAN.
(_cheerfully_) God bless you, Captain.

THE CENTURION.
(_scandalised_) Silence!

_The Captain, a patrician, handsome, about thirty-five, very cold and
distinguished, very superior and authoritative, steps up on a stone
seat at the west side of the square, behind the centurion, so as to
dominate the others more effectually._

**THE CAPTAIN**
Centurion.

THE CENTURION.
(_standing at attention and saluting_) Sir?

**THE CAPTAIN**
(_speaking stiffly and officially_) You will remind your men,
Centurion, that we are now entering Rome. You will instruct them that
once inside the gates of Rome they are in the presence of the Emperor.
You will make them understand that the lax discipline of the march
cannot be permitted here. You will instruct them to shave every day,
not every week. You will impress on them particularly that there must
be an end to the profanity and blasphemy of singing Christian hymns on
the march. I have to reprimand you, Centurion, for not only allowing
this, but actually doing it yourself.

**Cue**
THE CENTURION.
The men march better, Captain.

**THE CAPTAIN**
No doubt. For that reason an exception is made in the case of the march
called Onward Christian Soldiers. This may be sung, except when
marching through the forum or within hearing of the Emperor’s palace;
but the words must be altered to “Throw them to the Lions.”

_The Christians burst into shrieks of uncontrollable laughter, to the
great scandal of the Centurion._

CENTURION.
Silence! Silen-n-n-n-nce! Where’s your behavior? Is that the way to
listen to an officer? (_To the Captain_) That’s what we have to put up
with from these Christians every day, sir. They’re always laughing and
joking something scandalous. They’ve no religion: that’s how it is.

LAVINIA.
But I think the Captain meant us to laugh, Centurion. It was so funny.

CENTURION.
You’ll find out how funny it is when you’re thrown to the lions
to-morrow. (_To the Captain, who looks displeased_) Beg pardon, Sir.
**Cue**
(_To the Christians_) Silennnnce!

**THE CAPTAIN**
You are to instruct your men that all intimacy with Christian prisoners
must now cease. The men have fallen into habits of dependence upon the
prisoners, especially the female prisoners, for cooking, repairs to
uniforms, writing letters, and advice in their private affairs. In a
Roman soldier such dependence is inadmissible. Let me see no more of it
whilst we are in the city. Further, your orders are that in addressing
Christian prisoners, the manners and tone of your men must express
abhorrence and contempt. Any shortcoming in this respect will be
regarded as a breach of discipline. (_He turns to the prisoners_)
Prisoners.

**Cue**
CENTURION.
(_fiercely_) Prisonerrrrrs! Tention! Silence!

**THE CAPTAIN**
I call your attention, prisoners, to the fact that you may be called on
to appear in the Imperial Circus at any time from tomorrow onwards
according to the requirements of the managers. I may inform you that as
there is a shortage of Christians just now, you may expect to be called
on very soon.

LAVINIA.
What will they do to us, Captain?

**Cue**
CENTURION.
Silence!

**THE CAPTAIN**
The women will be conducted into the arena with the wild beasts of the
Imperial Menagerie, and will suffer the consequences. The men, if of an
age to bear arms, will be given weapons to defend themselves, if they
choose, against the Imperial Gladiators.

LAVINIA.
Captain: is there no hope that this cruel persecution—

**Cue**
CENTURION.
(_shocked_) Silence! Hold your tongue, there. Persecution, indeed!

**THE CAPTAIN**
(_unmoved and somewhat sardonic_) Persecution is not a term applicable
to the acts of the Emperor. The Emperor is the Defender of the Faith.
In throwing you to the lions he will be upholding the interests of
religion in Rome. If you were to throw him to the lions, that would no
doubt be persecution.

_The Christians again laugh heartily._

CENTURION.
(_horrified_) Silence, I tell you! Keep silence there. Did anyone ever
hear the like of this?

**Cue**
LAVINIA.
Captain: there will be nobody to appreciate your jokes when we are
gone.

**THE CAPTAIN**
(_unshaken in his official delivery_) I call the attention of the
female prisoner Lavinia to the fact that as the Emperor is a divine
personage, her imputation of cruelty is not only treason, but
sacrilege. I point out to her further that there is no foundation for
the charge, as the Emperor does not desire that any prisoner should
suffer; nor can any Christian be harmed save through his or her own
obstinacy. All that is necessary is to sacrifice to the gods: a simple
and convenient ceremony effected by dropping a pinch of incense on the
altar, after which the prisoner is at once set free. Under such
circumstances you have only your own perverse folly to blame if you
suffer. I suggest to you that if you cannot burn a morsel of incense as
a matter of conviction, you might at least do so as a matter of good
taste, to avoid shocking the religious convictions of your fellow
citizens. I am aware that these considerations do not weigh with
Christians; but it is my duty to call your attention to them in order
that you may have no ground for complaining of your treatment, or of
accusing the Emperor of cruelty when he is showing you the most signal
clemency. Looked at from this point of view, every Christian who has
perished in the arena has really committed suicide.

LAVINIA.
Captain: your jokes are too grim. Do not think it is easy for us to
die. Our faith makes life far stronger and more wonderful in us than
when we walked in darkness and had nothing to live for. Death is harder
for us than for you: 
**Cue**
the martyr’s agony is as bitter as his triumph is glorious.

**THE CAPTAIN**
(_rather troubled, addressing her personally and gravely_) A martyr,
Lavinia, is a fool. Your death will prove nothing.

**Cue**
LAVINIA.
Then why kill me?

**THE CAPTAIN**
I mean that truth, if there be any truth, needs no martyrs.

**Cue**
LAVINIA.
No; but my faith, like your sword, needs testing. Can you test your
sword except by staking your life on it?

**THE CAPTAIN**
(_suddenly resuming his official tone_) I call the attention of the
female prisoner to the fact that Christians are not allowed to draw the
Emperor’s officers into arguments and put questions to them for which
the military regulations provide no answer. (_The Christians titter_).

**Cue**
LAVINIA.
Captain: how CAN you?

**THE CAPTAIN**
I call the female prisoner’s attention specially to the fact that four
comfortable homes have been offered her by officers of this regiment,
of which she can have her choice the moment she chooses to sacrifice as
all well-bred Roman ladies do. I have no more to say to the prisoners.

**Cue**
CENTURION.
Dismiss! But stay where you are.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Centurion: you will remain here with your men in charge of the
prisoners until the arrival of three Christian prisoners in the custody
of a cohort of the tenth legion. Among these prisoners you will
particularly identify an armorer named Ferrovius, of dangerous
character and great personal strength, and a Greek tailor reputed to be
a sorcerer, by name Androcles. You will add the three to your charge
here and march them all to the Coliseum, where you will deliver them
into the custody of the master of the gladiators and take his receipt,
countersigned by the keeper of the beasts and the acting manager. You
understand your instructions?

**Cue**
CENTURION.
Yes, Sir.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Dismiss. (_He throws off his air of parade, and descends down from the
perch. The Centurion seats on it and prepares for a nap, whilst his men
stand at ease. The Christians sit down on the west side of the square,
glad to rest. Lavinia alone remains standing to speak to the Captain_).

**Cue**
LAVINIA.
Captain: is this man who is to join us the famous Ferrovius, who has
made such wonderful conversions in the northern cities?

**THE CAPTAIN**
Yes. We are warned that he has the strength of an elephant and the
temper of a mad bull. Also that he is stark mad. Not a model Christian,
it would seem.

**Cue**
LAVINIA.
You need not fear him if he is a Christian, Captain.

**THE CAPTAIN**
(_coldly_) I shall not fear him in any case, Lavinia.

**Cue**
LAVINIA.
(_her eyes dancing_) How brave of you, Captain!

**THE CAPTAIN**
You are right: it was silly thing to say. (_In a lower tone, humane and
urgent_) Lavinia: do Christians know how to love?

**Cue**
LAVINIA.
(_composedly_) Yes, Captain: they love even their enemies.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Is that easy?

**Cue**
LAVINIA.
Very easy, Captain, when their enemies are as handsome as you.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Lavinia: you are laughing at me.

**Cue**
LAVINIA.
At you, Captain! Impossible.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Then you are flirting with me, which is worse. Don’t be foolish.

**Cue**
LAVINIA.
But such a very handsome captain.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Incorrigible! (_Urgently_) Listen to me. The men in that audience
tomorrow will be the vilest of voluptuaries: men in whom the only
passion excited by a beautiful woman is a lust to see her tortured and
torn shrieking limb from limb. It is a crime to dignify that passion.
It is offering yourself for violation by the whole rabble of the
streets and the riff-raff of the court at the same time. Why will you
not choose rather a kindly love and an honorable alliance?

**Cue**
LAVINIA.
They cannot violate my soul. I alone can do that by sacrificing to
false gods.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Sacrifice then to the true God. What does his name matter? We call him
Jupiter. The Greeks call him Zeus. Call him what you will as you drop
the incense on the altar flame: He will understand.

LAVINIA.
No. I couldn’t. That is the strange thing, Captain, that a little pinch
of incense should make all that difference. Religion is such a great
thing that when I meet really religious people we are friends at once,
no matter what name we give to the divine will that made us and moves
us. Oh, do you think that I, a woman, would quarrel with you for
sacrificing to a woman god like Diana, if Diana meant to you what
Christ means to me? No: we should kneel side by side before her altar
like two children. But when men who believe neither in my god nor in
their own—men who do not know the meaning of the word religion—when
these men drag me to the foot of an iron statue that has become the
symbol of the terror and darkness through which they walk, of their
cruelty and greed, of their hatred of God and their oppression of
man—when they ask me to pledge my soul before the people that this
hideous idol is God, and that all this wickedness and falsehood is
divine truth, I cannot do it, not if they could put a thousand cruel
deaths on me. I tell you, it is physically impossible. Listen, Captain:
did you ever try to catch a mouse in your hand? Once there was a dear
little mouse that used to come out and play on my table as I was
reading. I wanted to take him in my hand and caress him; and sometimes
he got among my books so that he could not escape me when I stretched
out my hand. And I did stretch out my hand; but it always came back in
spite of me. I was not afraid of him in my heart; but my hand refused:
it is not in the nature of my hand to touch a mouse. Well, Captain, if
I took a pinch of incense in my hand and stretched it out over the
altar fire, my hand would come back. My body would be true to my faith
even if you could corrupt my mind. And all the time I should believe
more in Diana than my persecutors have ever believed in anything. 
**Cue**
Can you understand that?

**THE CAPTAIN**
(_simply_) Yes: I understand that. But my hand would not come back. The
hand that holds the sword has been trained not to come back from
anything but victory.

**Cue**
LAVINIA.
Not even from death?

**THE CAPTAIN**
Least of all from death.

**Cue**
LAVINIA.
Then I must not come back either. A woman has to be braver than a
soldier.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Prouder, you mean.

**Cue**
LAVINIA.
(_startled_) Prouder! You call our courage pride!

**THE CAPTAIN**
There is no such thing as courage: there is only pride. You Christians
are the proudest devils on earth.

LAVINIA.
(_hurt_) Pray God then my pride may never become a false pride. (_She
turns away as if she did not wish to continue the conversation, but
softens and says to him with a smile_) 
**Cue**
Thank you for trying to save me from death.

**THE CAPTAIN**
I knew it was no use; but one tries in spite of one’s knowledge.

**Cue**
LAVINIA.
Something stirs, even in the iron breast of a Roman soldier!

**THE CAPTAIN**
It will soon be iron again. I have seen many women die, and forgotten
them in a week.

**Cue**
LAVINIA.
Remember me for a fortnight, handsome Captain. I shall be watching you,
perhaps.

**THE CAPTAIN**
From the skies? Do not deceive yourself, Lavinia. There is no future
for you beyond the grave.

LAVINIA.
What does that matter? Do you think I am only running away from the
terrors of life into the comfort of heaven? If there were no future, or
if the future were one of torment, I should have to go just the same.
**Cue**
The hand of God is upon me.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Yes: when all is said, we are both patricians, Lavinia, and must die
for our beliefs. Farewell. (_He offers her his hand. She takes it and
presses it. He walks away, trim and calm. She looks after him for a
moment, and cries a little as he disappears through the eastern arch. A
trumpet-call is heard from the road through the western arch_).


ACT II

**Cue**
_Before the Editor can retort, the Call Boy rushes up through the
passage; and the Captain comes from the Emperor’s box and descends the
steps._

**Cue**
THE CALL BOY.
In with you: into the arena. The stage is waiting.

**THE CAPTAIN**
The Emperor is waiting. (_To the Editor_) What are you dreaming of,
man? Send your men in at once.

THE EDITOR.
Yes, Sir: it’s these Christians hanging back.

FERROVIUS.
(_in a voice of thunder_) Liar!

THE EDITOR.
(_not heeding him_) March. (_The gladiators told off to fight with the
Christians march down the passage_) Follow up there, you.

THE CHRISTIAN MEN AND WOMEN.
(_as they part_) Be steadfast, brother. Farewell. Hold up the faith,
brother. Farewell. Go to glory, dearest. Farewell. Remember: we are
praying for you. Farewell. Be strong, brother. Farewell. Don’t forget
that the divine love and our love surround you. Farewell. Nothing can
hurt you: remember that, brother. Farewell. Eternal glory, dearest.
Farewell.

THE EDITOR.
(_out of patience_) Shove them in, there.

_The remaining gladiators and the Call Boy make a movement towards
them._

FERROVIUS.
(_interposing_) Touch them, dogs; and we die here, and cheat the
heathen of their spectacle. (_To his fellow Christians_) Brothers: the
great moment has come. That passage is your hill to Calvary. Mount it
bravely, but meekly; and remember! not a word of reproach, not a blow
nor a struggle. Go. (_They go out through the passage. He turns to
Lavinia_) Farewell.

LAVINIA.
You forget: I must follow before you are cold.

FERROVIUS.
It is true. Do not envy me because I pass before you to glory. (_He
goes through the passage_).

THE EDITOR.
(_to the Call Boy_) Sickening work, this. Why can’t they all be thrown
to the lions? It’s not a man’s job. (_He throws himself moodily into
his chair_).

_The remaining gladiators go back to their former places indifferently.
The Call Boy shrugs his shoulders and squats down at the entrance to
the passage, near the Editor._

**Cue**
_Lavinia and the Christian women sit down again, wrung with grief, some
weeping silently, some praying, some calm and steadfast. Androcles sits
down at Lavinia’s feet._
**THE CAPTAIN** 
_The Captain stands on the stairs, watching her curiously._

ANDROCLES.
I’m glad I haven’t to fight. That would really be an awful martyrdom. I
am lucky.

LAVINIA.
(_looking at him with a pang of remorse_). Androcles: burn the incense:
you’ll be forgiven. Let my death atone for both. I feel as if I were
killing you.

**Cue**
ANDROCLES.
Don’t think of me, sister. Think of yourself. That will keep your heart
up.

**THE CAPTAIN**
_The Captain laughs sardonically._

**Cue**
LAVINIA.
(_startled: she had forgotten his presence_) Are you there, handsome
Captain? Have you come to see me die?

**THE CAPTAIN**
(_coming to her side_) I am on duty with the Emperor, Lavinia.

**Cue**
LAVINIA.
Is it part of your duty to laugh at us?

**THE CAPTAIN**
No: that is part of my private pleasure. Your friend here is a
humorist. I laughed at his telling you to think of yourself to keep up
your heart. I say, think of yourself and burn the incense.

**Cue**
LAVINIA.
He is not a humorist: he was right. You ought to know that, Captain:
you have been face to face with death.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Not with certain death, Lavinia. Only death in battle, which spares
more men than death in bed. What you are facing is certain death. You
have nothing left now but your faith in this craze of yours: this
Christianity. Are your Christian fairy stories any truer than our
stories about Jupiter and Diana, in which, I may tell you, I believe no
more than the Emperor does, or any educated man in Rome?

LAVINIA.
Captain: all that seems nothing to me now. I’ll not say that death is a
terrible thing; but I will say that it is so real a thing that when it
comes close, all the imaginary things—all the stories, as you call
them—fade into mere dreams beside that inexorable reality. I know now
that I am not dying for stories or dreams. 
**Cue**
Did you hear of the dreadful thing that happened here while we were waiting?

**THE CAPTAIN**
I heard that one of your fellows bolted, and ran right into the jaws of
the lion. I laughed. I still laugh.

**Cue**
LAVINIA.
Then you don’t understand what that meant?

**THE CAPTAIN**
It meant that the lion had a cur for his breakfast.

LAVINIA.
It meant more than that, Captain. It meant that a man cannot die for a
story and a dream. None of us believed the stories and the dreams more
devoutly than poor Spintho; but he could not face the great reality.
What he would have called my faith has been oozing away minute by
minute whilst I’ve been sitting here, with death coming nearer and
nearer, with reality becoming realler and realler, 
**Cue**
with stories and dreams fading away into nothing.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Are you then going to die for nothing?

LAVINIA.
Yes: that is the wonderful thing. It is since all the stories and
dreams have gone that I have now no doubt at all that 
**Cue**
I must die for something greater than dreams or stories.

**THE CAPTAIN**
But for what?

LAVINIA.
I don’t know. If it were for anything small enough to know, it would be
too small to die for. I think I’m going to die for God. 
**Cue**
Nothing else is real enough to die for.

**THE CAPTAIN**
What is God?

**Cue**
LAVINIA.
When we know that, Captain, we shall be gods ourselves.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Lavinia; come down to earth. Burn the incense and marry me.

LAVINIA.
Handsome Captain: would you marry me if I hauled down the flag in the
day of battle and burnt the incense? Sons take after their mothers, you
know. 
**Cue**
Do you want your son to be a coward?

**THE CAPTAIN**
(_strongly moved_). By great Diana, I think I would strangle you if you
gave in now.

**Cue**
LAVINIA.
(_putting her hand on the head of Androcles_) The hand of God is on us
three, Captain.

**THE CAPTAIN**
What nonsense it all is! And what a monstrous thing that you should die
for such nonsense, and that I should look on helplessly when my whole
soul cries out against it! Die then if you must; but at least I can cut
the Emperor’s throat and then my own when I see your blood.

_The Emperor throws open the door of his box angrily, and appears in
wrath on the threshold. The Editor, the Call Boy, and the gladiators
spring to their feet._

THE EMPEROR.
The Christians will not fight; and your curs cannot get their blood up
to attack them. It’s all that fellow with the blazing eyes. Send for
the whip. (_The Call Boy rushes out on the east side for the whip_). If
that will not move them, bring the hot irons. The man is like a
mountain. (_He returns angrily into the box and slams the door_).

_The Call Boy returns with a man in a hideous Etruscan mask, carrying a
whip. They both rush down the passage into the arena._

LAVINIA.
(_rising_) Oh, that is unworthy. Can they not kill him without
dishonoring him?

ANDROCLES.
(_scrambling to his feet and running into the middle of the space
between the staircases_) It’s dreadful. Now I want to fight. I can’t
bear the sight of a whip. The only time I ever hit a man was when he
lashed an old horse with a whip. It was terrible: I danced on his face
when he was on the ground. He mustn’t strike Ferrovius: I’ll go into
the arena and kill him first. (_He makes a wild dash into the passage.
As he does so a great clamor is heard from the arena, ending in wild
applause. The gladiators listen and look inquiringly at one another_).

THE EDITOR.
What’s up now?

**Cue**
LAVINIA.
(_to the Captain_) What has happened, do you think?

**THE CAPTAIN**
What CAN happen? They are killing them, I suppose.

ANDROCLES.
(_running in through the passage, screaming with horror and hiding his
eyes_)!!!

LAVINIA.
Androcles, Androcles: what’s the matter?

ANDROCLES.
Oh, don’t ask me, don’t ask me. Something too dreadful. Oh! (_He
crouches by her and hides his face in her robe, sobbing_).

THE CALL BOY. (_rushing through from the passage as before_) Ropes and
hooks there! Ropes and hooks.

THE EDITOR.
Well, need you excite yourself about it? (_Another burst of applause_).

_Two slaves in Etruscan masks, with ropes and drag hooks, hurry in._

ONE OF THE SLAVES. How many dead?

THE CALL BOY.
Six. (_The slave blows a whistle twice; and four more masked slaves
rush through into the arena with the same apparatus_) And the basket.
Bring the baskets. 
**Cue**
(_The slave whistles three times, and runs through
the passage with his companion_).

**THE CAPTAIN**
Who are the baskets for?

THE CALL BOY.
For the whip. He’s in pieces. They’re all in pieces, more or less.
(_Lavinia hides her face_).

(_Two more masked slaves come in with a basket and follow the others
into the arena, as the Call Boy turns to the gladiators and exclaims,
exhausted_)

Boys, he’s killed the lot.

THE EMPEROR.
(_again bursting from his box, this time in an ecstasy of delight_)
Where is he? Magnificent! He shall have a laurel crown.

_Ferrovius, madly waving his bloodstained sword, rushes through the
passage in despair, followed by his co-religionists, and by the
menagerie keeper, who goes to the gladiators. The gladiators draw their
swords nervously._

FERROVIUS.
Lost! lost forever! I have betrayed my Master. Cut off this right hand:
it has offended. Ye have swords, my brethren: strike.

LAVINIA.
No, no. What have you done, Ferrovius?

FERROVIUS.
I know not; but there was blood behind my eyes; and there’s blood on my
sword. What does that mean?

THE EMPEROR.
(_enthusiastically, on the landing outside his box_) What does it mean?
It means that you are the greatest man in Rome. It means that you shall
have a laurel crown of gold. Superb fighter, I could almost yield you
my throne. It is a record for my reign: I shall live in history. Once,
in Domitian’s time, a Gaul slew three men in the arena and gained his
freedom. But when before has one naked man slain six armed men of the
bravest and best? The persecution shall cease: if Christians can fight
like this, I shall have none but Christians to fight for me. (_To the
Gladiators_) You are ordered to become Christians, you there: do you
hear?

**Cue**
RETIARIUS. It is all one to us, Caesar. Had I been there with my net,
the story would have been different.

**THE CAPTAIN**
(_suddenly seizing Lavinia by the wrist and dragging her up the steps
to the Emperor_) Caesar this woman is the sister of Ferrovius. If she
is thrown to the lions he will fret. He will lose weight; get out of
condition.

THE EMPEROR.
The lions? Nonsense! (_To Lavinia_) Madam: I am proud to have the honor
of making your acquaintance. Your brother is the glory of Rome.

LAVINIA.
But my friends here. Must they die?

THE EMPEROR.
Die! Certainly not. There has never been the slightest idea of harming
them. Ladies and gentlemen: you are all free. Pray go into the front of
the house and enjoy the spectacle to which your brother has so
splendidly contributed. 
**Cue**
Captain: oblige me by conducting them to the
seats reserved for my personal friends.

THE MENAGERIE KEEPER.
Caesar: I must have one Christian for the lion. The people have been
promised it; and they will tear the decorations to bits if they are
disappointed.

THE EMPEROR.
True, true: we must have somebody for the new lion.

FERROVIUS.
Throw me to him. Let the apostate perish.

THE EMPEROR.
No, no: you would tear him in pieces, my friend; and we cannot afford
to throw away lions as if they were mere slaves. But we must have
somebody. This is really extremely awkward.

THE MENAGERIE KEEPER.
Why not that little Greek chap? He’s not a Christian: he’s a sorcerer.

THE EMPEROR.
The very thing: he will do very well.

THE CALL BOY. (_issuing from the passage_) Number twelve. The Christian
for the new lion.

ANDROCLES.
(_rising, and pulling himself sadly together_) Well, it was to be,
after all.

LAVINIA.
I’ll go in his place, Caesar. Ask the Captain whether they do not like
best to see a woman torn to pieces. He told me so yesterday.

THE EMPEROR.
There is something in that: there is certainly something in that—if
only I could feel sure that your brother would not fret.

ANDROCLES.
No: I should never have another happy hour. No: on the faith of a
Christian and the honor of a tailor, I accept the lot that has fallen
on me. If my wife turns up, give her my love and say that my wish was
that she should be happy with her next, poor fellow! Caesar: go to your
box and see how a tailor can die. Make way for number twelve there.
(_He marches out along the passage_).

_The vast audience in the amphitheatre now sees the Emperor re-enter
his box and take his place as Androcles, desperately frightened, but
still marching with piteous devotion, emerges from the other end of the
passage, and finds himself at the focus of thousands of eager eyes. The
lion’s cage, with a heavy portcullis grating, is on his left. The
Emperor gives a signal. A gong sounds. Androcles shivers at the sound;
then falls on his knees and prays._

_The grating rises with a clash. The lion bounds into the arena. He
rushes round frisking in his freedom. He sees Androcles. He stops;
rises stiffly by straightening his legs; stretches out his nose forward
and his tail in a horizontal line behind, like a pointer, and utters an
appalling roar. Androcles crouches and hides his face in his hands. The
lion gathers himself for a spring, swishing his tail to and fro through
the dust in an ecstasy of anticipation. Androcles throws up his hands
in supplication to heaven. The lion checks at the sight of Androcles’s
face. He then steals towards him; smells him; arches his back; purrs
like a motor car; finally rubs himself against Androcles, knocking him
over. Androcles, supporting himself on his wrist, looks affrightedly at
the lion. The lion limps on three paws, holding up the other as if it
was wounded. A flash of recognition lights up the face of Androcles. He
flaps his hand as if it had a thorn in it, and pretends to pull the
thorn out and to hurt himself. The lion nods repeatedly. Androcles
holds out his hands to the lion, who gives him both paws, which he
shakes with enthusiasm. They embrace rapturously, finally waltz round
the arena amid a sudden burst of deafening applause, and out through
the passage, the Emperor watching them in breathless astonishment until
they disappear, when he rushes from his box and descends the steps in
frantic excitement._

THE EMPEROR.
My friends, an incredible! an amazing thing! has happened. I can no
longer doubt the truth of Christianity. (_The Christians press to him
joyfully_) This Christian sorcerer—(_with a yell, he breaks off as he
sees Androcles and the lion emerge from the passage, waltzing. He bolts
wildly up the steps into his box, and slams the door. All, Christians
and gladiators’ alike, fly for their lives, the gladiators bolting into
the arena, the others in all directions. The place is emptied with
magical suddenness_).

ANDROCLES.
(_naively_) Now I wonder why they all run away from us like that. (_The
lion combining a series of yawns, purrs, and roars, achieves something
very like a laugh_).

THE EMPEROR.
(_standing on a chair inside his box and looking over the wall_)
Sorcerer: I command you to put that lion to death instantly. It is
guilty of high treason. Your conduct is most disgra— (_the lion charges
at him up the stairs_) help! (_He disappears. The lion rears against
the box; looks over the partition at him, and roars. The Emperor darts
out through the door and down to Androcles, pursued by the lion._)

ANDROCLES.
Don’t run away, sir: he can’t help springing if you run. (_He seizes
the Emperor and gets between him and the lion, who stops at once_).
Don’t be afraid of him.

THE EMPEROR.
I am NOT afraid of him. (_The lion crouches, growling. The Emperor
clutches Androcles_) Keep between us.

ANDROCLES.
Never be afraid of animals, your Worship: that’s the great secret.
He’ll be as gentle as a lamb when he knows that you are his friend.
Stand quite still; and smile; and let him smell you all over just to
reassure him; for, you see, he’s afraid of you; and he must examine you
thoroughly before he gives you his confidence. (_To the lion_) Come
now, Tommy; and speak nicely to the Emperor, the great, good Emperor
who has power to have all our heads cut off if we don’t behave very,
VERY respectfully to him.

_The lion utters a fearful roar. The Emperor dashes madly up the steps,
across the landing, and down again on the other side, with the lion in
hot pursuit. Androcles rushes after the lion; overtakes him as he is
descending; and throws himself on his back, trying to use his toes as a
brake. Before he can stop him the lion gets hold of the trailing end of
the Emperor’s robe._

ANDROCLES.
Oh bad wicked Tommy, to chase the Emperor like that! Let go the
Emperor’s robe at once, sir: where’s your manners? (_The lion growls
and worries the robe_). Don’t pull it away from him, your worship. He’s
only playing. Now I shall be really angry with you, Tommy, if you don’t
let go. (_The lion growls again_) I’ll tell you what it is, sir: he
thinks you and I are not friends.

THE EMPEROR.
(_trying to undo the clasp of his brooch_) Friends! You infernal
scoundrel (_the lion growls_) don’t let him go. Curse this brooch! I
can’t get it loose.

ANDROCLES.
We mustn’t let him lash himself into a rage. You must show him that you
are my particular friend—if you will have the condescension. (_He
seizes the Emperor’s hands, and shakes them cordially_), Look, Tommy:
the nice Emperor is the dearest friend Andy Wandy has in the whole
world: he loves him like a brother.

THE EMPEROR.
You little brute, you damned filthy little dog of a Greek tailor: I’ll
have you burnt alive for daring to touch the divine person of the
Emperor. (_The lion roars_).

ANDROCLES.
Oh don’t talk like that, sir. He understands every word you say: all
animals do: they take it from the tone of your voice. (_The lion growls
and lashes his tail_). I think he’s going to spring at your worship. If
you wouldn’t mind saying something affectionate. (_The lion roars_).

THE EMPEROR.
(_shaking Androcles’ hands frantically_) My dearest Mr. Androcles, my
sweetest friend, my long lost brother, come to my arms. (_He embraces
Androcles_). Oh, what an abominable smell of garlic!

_The lion lets go the robe and rolls over on his back, clasping his
forepaws over one another coquettishly above his nose._

ANDROCLES.
There! You see, your worship, a child might play with him now. See!
(_He tickles the lion’s belly. The lion wriggles ecstatically_). Come
and pet him.

THE EMPEROR.
I must conquer these unkingly terrors. Mind you don’t go away from him,
though. (_He pats the lion’s chest_).

ANDROCLES.
Oh, sir, how few men would have the courage to do that—

THE EMPEROR.
Yes: it takes a bit of nerve. Let us invite the Court in and frighten
them. Is he safe, do you think?

ANDROCLES.
Quite safe now, sir.

THE EMPEROR.
(_majestically_) What ho, there! All who are within hearing, return
without fear. Caesar has tamed the lion. (_All the fugitives steal
cautiously in. The menagerie keeper comes from the passage with other
keepers armed with iron bars and tridents_). Take those things away. I
have subdued the beast. (_He places his foot on it_).

**Cue**
FERROVIUS.
(_timidly approaching the Emperor and looking down with awe on the
lion_) It is strange that I, who fear no man, should fear a lion.

**THE CAPTAIN**
Every man fears something, Ferrovius.

THE EMPEROR.
How about the Pretorian Guard now?

FERROVIUS.
In my youth I worshipped Mars, the God of War. I turned from him to
serve the Christian god; but today the Christian god forsook me; and
Mars overcame me and took back his own. The Christian god is not yet.
He will come when Mars and I are dust; but meanwhile I must serve the
gods that are, not the God that will be. Until then I accept service in
the Guard, Caesar.

THE EMPEROR.
Very wisely said. All really sensible men agree that the prudent course
is to be neither bigoted in our attachment to the old nor rash and
unpractical in keeping an open mind for the new, 
**Cue**
but to make the best of both dispensations.

**THE CAPTAIN**
What do you say, Lavinia? Will you too be prudent?

LAVINIA.
(_on the stair_) No: I’ll strive for the coming of the God who is not
yet.

**THE CAPTAIN**
May I come and argue with you occasionally?

**Cue**
LAVINIA.
Yes, handsome Captain: you may. 
**THE CAPTAIN**
(_He kisses her hands_).

THE EMPEROR.
And now, my friends, though I do not, as you see, fear this lion, yet
the strain of his presence is considerable; for none of us can feel
quite sure what he will do next.

THE MENAGERIE KEEPER.
Caesar: give us this Greek sorcerer to be a slave in the menagerie. He
has a way with the beasts.

ANDROCLES.
(_distressed_). Not if they are in cages. They should not be kept in
cages. They must all be let out.

THE EMPEROR.
I give this sorcerer to be a slave to the first man who lays hands on
him. (_The menagerie keepers and the gladiators rush for Androcles. The
lion starts up and faces them. They surge back_). You see how
magnanimous we Romans are, Androcles. We suffer you to go in peace.

ANDROCLES.
I thank your worship. I thank you all, ladies and gentlemen. Come,
Tommy. Whilst we stand together, no cage for you: no slavery for me.
(_He goes out with the lion, everybody crowding away to give him as
wide a berth as possible_).


It was currently reported in the Berlin newspapers that when Androcles
was first performed in Berlin, the Crown Prince rose and left the
house, unable to endure the (_I hope_) very clear and fair exposition
of autocratic Imperialism given by the Roman captain to his Christian
prisoners. No English Imperialist was intelligent and earnest enough to
do the same in London. If the report is correct, I confirm the logic of
the Crown Prince, and am glad to find myself so well understood. But I
can assure him that the Empire which served for my model when I wrote
Androcles was, as he is now finding to his cost, much nearer my home
than the German one.
