## 1: Death Strikes a King ##

The king of Vendhya was dying.  Through the hot, stifling night the temple gongs boomed and the conchs roared.  Their clamor was a faint echo in the gold-domed chamber where Bunda Chand struggled on the velvet-cushioned dais.  Beads of sweat glistened on his dark skin; his fingers twisted the gold-worked fabric beneath him.  He was young; no spear had touched him, no poison lurked in his wine.  But his veins stood out like blue cords on his temples, and his eyes dilated with the nearness of death.  Trembling slave-girls knelt at the foot of the dais, and leaning down to him, watching him with passionate intensity, was his sister, the Devi Yasmina.  With her was the *wazam*, a noble grown old in the royal court.

She threw up her head in a gusty gesture of wrath and despair as the thunder of the distant drums reached her ears.

_*YASMINA*_
The priests and their clamor! _(she exclaimed.)_  They are no wiser than the leeches who are helpless!  Nay, he dies and none can say why.  He is dying now--and I stand here helpless, who would burn the whole city and spill the blood of thousands to save him.

_*WAZAM*_
Not a man of Ayodhya but would die in his place, if it might be, Devi, _(answered the *wazam*.)_  This poison--

_*YASMINA*_
I tell you it is not poison! _(she cried.)_  Since his birth he has been guarded so closely that the cleverest poisoners of the East could not reach him.  Five skulls bleaching on the Tower of the Kites can testify to attempts which were made--and which failed.  As you well know, there are ten men and ten women whose sole duty is to taste his food and wine, and fifty armed warriors guard his chamber as they guard it now.  No, it is not poison; it is sorcery--black, ghastly magic--

She ceased as the king spoke; his livid lips did not move, and there was no recognition in his glassy eyes.  But his voice rose in an eery call, indistinct and far away, as if called to her from beyond vast, wind-blown gulfs.

_*KING*_
Yasmina!  Yasmina!  My sister, where are you?  I can not find you.  All is darkness, and the roaring of great winds!

_*YASMINA*_
Brother! _(cried Yasmina, catching his limp hand in a convulsive grasp.)_  I am here!  Do you not know me--

Her voice died at the utter vacancy of his face.  A low confused moan waned from his mouth.  The slave-girls at the foot of the dais whimpered with fear, and Yasmina beat her breast in anguish.

_`BREAK`_
       * * * * *

In another part of the city a man stood in a latticed balcony overlooking a long street in which torches tossed luridly, smokily revealing upturned dark faces and the whites of gleaming eyes.  A long-drawn wailing rose from the multitude.

The man shrugged his broad shoulders and turned back into the arabesque chamber.  He was a tall man, compactly built, and richly clad.

_*KERIM SHAH*_
The king is not yet dead, but the dirge is sounded, _(he said to another man who sat cross-legged on a mat in a corner.  This man was clad in a brown camel-hair robe and sandals, and a green turban was on his head.  His expression was tranquil, his gaze impersonal.)_

_*KHEMSA*_
The people know he will never see another dawn, _(this man answered._)

The first speaker favored him with a long, searching stare.

_*KERIM SHAH*_
What I can not understand, _(he said,)_ is why I have had to wait so long for your masters to strike.  If they have slain the king now, why could they not have slain him months ago?

_*KHEMSA*_
Even the arts you call sorcery are governed by cosmic laws, _(answered the man in the green turban.)_  The stars direct these actions, as in other affairs.  Not even my masters can alter the stars.  Not until the heavens were in the proper order could they perform this necromancy. _(With a long, stained fingernail he mapped the constellations on the marble-tiled floor.)_  The slant of the moon presaged evil for the king of Vendhya; the stars are in turmoil, the Serpent in the House of the Elephant.  During such juxtaposition, the invisible guardians are removed from the spirit of Bhunda Chand.  A path is opened in the unseen realms, and once a point of contact was established, mighty powers were put in play along that path.

_*KERIM SHAH*_
Point of contact? _(inquired the other.)_  'Do you mean that lock of Bhunda Chand's hair?

_*KHEMSA*_
Yes.  All discarded portions of the human body still remain part of it, attached to it by intangible connections.  The priests of Asura have a dim inkling of this truth, and so all nail trimmings, hair and other waste products of the persons of the royal family are carefully reduced to ashes and the ashes hidden.  But at the urgent entreaty of the princess of Khosala, who loved Bhunda Chand vainly, he gave her a lock of his long black hair as a token of remembrance.  When my masters decided upon his doom, the lock, in its golden, jewel-encrusted case, was stolen from under her pillow while she slept, and another substituted, so like the first that she never knew the difference.  Then the genuine lock travelled by camel-caravan up the long, long road to Peshkhauri, thence up the Zhaibar Pass, until it reached the hands of those for whom it was intended.

_*KERIM SHAH*_
Only a lock of hair, _(murmured the nobleman.)_

_*KHEMSA*_
By which a soul is drawn from its body and across gulfs of echoing space, _(returned the man on the mat.)_

The nobleman studied him curiously.

_*KERIM SHAH*_
I do not know if you are a man or a demon, Khemsa, _(he said at last.)_  Few of us are what we seem.  I, whom the Kshatriyas know as Kerim Shah, a prince from Iranistan, am no greater a masquerader than most men.  They are all traitors in one way or another, and half of them know not whom they serve.  There at least I have no doubts; for I serve King Yezdigerd of Turan.

_*KHEMSA*_
And I the Black Seers of Yimsha, _(said Khemsa;)_ and my masters are greater than yours, for they have accomplished by their arts what Yezdigerd could not with a hundred thousand swords.

_`BREAK`_
       * * * * *

Outside, the moan of the tortured thousands shuddered up to the stars which crusted the sweating Vendhyan night, and the conchs bellowed like oxen in pain.

In the gardens of the palace the torches glinted on polished helmets and curved swords and gold-chased corselets.  All the noble-born fighting-men of Ayodhya were gathered in the great palace or about it, and at each broad-arched gate and door fifty archers stood on guard, with bows in their hands.  But Death stalked through the royal palace and none could stay his ghostly tread.

On the dais under the golden dome the king cried out again, racked by awful paroxysms.  Again his voice came faintly and far away, and again the Devi bent to him, trembling with a fear that was darker than the terror of death.

_*KING*_
Yasmina! _(Again that far, weirdly dreeing cry, from realms immeasurable.)_  Aid me!  I am far from my mortal house!  Wizards have drawn my soul through the wind-blown darkness.  They seek to snap the silver cord that binds me to my dying body.  They cluster around me; their hands are taloned, their eyes are red like flame burning in darkness.  *Aie*, save me, my sister!  Their fingers sear me like fire!  They would slay my body and damn my soul!  What is this they bring before me?--*Aie!*

_`BREAK`_
       * * * * *

At the terror in his hopeless cry Yasmina screamed uncontrollably and threw herself bodily upon him in the abandon of her anguish.  He was torn by a terrible convulsion; foam flew from his contorted lips and his writhing fingers left their marks on the girl's shoulders.  But the glassy blankness passed from his eyes like smoke blown from a fire, and he looked up at his sister with recognition.

_*YASMINA*_
Brother! _(she sobbed.)_  'Brother--'

_*KING*_
Swift! _(he gasped, and his weakening voice was rational.)_  I know now what brings me to the pyre.  I have been on a far journey and I understand.  I have been ensorcelled by the wizards of the Himelians.  They drew my soul out of my body and far away, into a stone room.  There they strove to break the silver cord of life, and thrust my soul into the body of a foul night-weird their sorcery summoned up from hell.  Ah!  I feel their pull upon me now!  Your cry and the grip of your fingers brought me back, but I am going fast.  My soul clings to my body, but its hold weakens.  Quick--kill me, before they can trap my soul for ever!

_*YASMINA*_
I cannot! _(she wailed, smiting her naked breasts.)_

Swiftly, I command you! _(There was the old imperious note in his failing whisper.)_  You have never disobeyed me--obey my last command!  Send my soul clean to Asura!  Haste, lest you damn me to spend eternity as a filthy gaunt of darkness.  Strike, I command you!  *Strike!*

_*KING*_
Sobbing wildly, Yasmina plucked a jeweled dagger from her girdle and plunged it to the hilt in his breast.  He stiffened and then went limp, a grim smile curving his dead lips.  Yasmina hurled herself face-down on the rush-covered floor, beating the reeds with her clenched hands.  Outside, the gongs and conchs brayed and thundered and the priests gashed themselves with copper knives.
## 2: A Barbarian from the Hills ##

Chunder Shan, governor of Peshkhauri, laid down his golden pen and carefully scanned that which he had written on parchment that bore his official seal. He had ruled Peshkhauri so long only because he weighed his every word, spoken or written. Danger breeds caution, and only a wary man lives long in that wild country where the hot Vendhyan plains meet the crags of the Himelians. An hour's ride westward or northward and one crossed the border and was among the Hills where men lived by the law of the knife.

The governor was alone in his chamber, seated at his ornately carven table of inlaid ebony. Through the wide window, open for the coolness, he could see a square of the blue Himelian night, dotted with great white stars. An adjacent parapet was a shadowy line, and further crenelles and embrasures were barely hinted at in the dim starlight. The governor's fortress was strong, and situated outside the walls of the city it guarded. The breeze that stirred the tapestries on the wall brought faint noises from the streets of Peshkhauri--occasional snatches of wailing song, or the thrum of a cithern.

The governor read what he had written, slowly, with his open hand shading his eyes from the bronze butterlamp, his lips moving. Absently, as he read, he heard the drum of horses' hoofs outside the barbican, the sharp staccato of the guards' challenge. He did not heed, intent upon his letter. It was addressed to the *wazam* of Vendhya, at the royal court of Ayodhya, and it stated, after the customary salutations:

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
Let it be known to your excellency that I have faithfully carried out your excellency's instructions. The seven tribesmen are well guarded in their prison, and I have repeatedly sent word into the hills that their chief come in person to bargain for their release. But he has made no move, except to send word that unless they are freed he will burn Peshkhauri and cover his saddle with my hide, begging your excellency's indulgence. This he is quite capable of attempting, and I have tripled the numbers of the lance guards. The man is not a native of Ghulistan. I cannot with certainty predict his next move. But since it is the wish of the Devi--

He was out of his ivory chair and on his feet facing the arched door, all in one instant. He snatched at the curved sword lying in its ornate scabbard on the table, and then checked the movement.

It was a woman who had entered unannounced, a woman whose gossamer robes did not conceal the rich garments beneath them any more than they concealed the suppleness and beauty of her tall, slender figure. A filmy veil fell below her breasts, supported by a flowing headdress bound about with a triple gold braid and adorned with a golden crescent. Her dark eyes regarded the astonished governor over the veil, and then with an imperious gesture of her white hand, she uncovered her face.

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
Devi!

The governor dropped to his knees before her, surprize and confusion somewhat spoiling the stateliness of his obeisance. With a gesture she motioned him to rise, and he hastened to lead her to the ivory chair, all the while bowing level with his girdle. But his first words were of reproof.

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
Your Majesty! This was most unwise! The border is unsettled. Raids from the hills are incessant. You came with a large attendance?

_*YASMINA*_.
An ample retinue followed me to Peshkhauri,

she answered.

_*YASMINA*_.
I lodged my people there and came on to the fort with my maid, Gitara.

Chunder Shan groaned in horror.

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
Devi! You do not understand the peril. An hour's ride from this spot the hills swarm with barbarians who make a profession of murder and rapine. Women have been stolen and men stabbed between the fort and the city. Peshkhauri is not like your southern provinces--

_*YASMINA*_.
But I am here, and unharmed,

she interrupted with a trace of impatience.

_*YASMINA*_.
I showed my signet ring to the guard at the gate, and to the one outside your door, and they admitted me unannounced, not knowing me, but supposing me to be a secret courier from Ayodhya. Let us not now waste time. 'You have received no word from the chief of the barbarians?

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
None save threats and curses, Devi. He is wary and suspicious. He deems it a trap, and perhaps he is not to be blamed. The Kshatriyas have not always kept their promises to the hill people.

_*YASMINA*_.
He must be brought to terms!

broke in Yasmina, the knuckles of her clenched hands showing white.

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
I do not understand.

The governor shook his head.

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
When I chanced to capture these seven hill-men, I reported their capture to the *wazam*, as is the custom, and then, before I could hang them, there came an order to hold them and communicate with their chief. This I did, but the man holds aloof, as I have said. These men are of the tribe of Afghulis, but he is a foreigner from the west, and he is called Conan. I have threatened to hang them tomorrow at dawn, if he does not come.

_*YASMINA*_.
Good!

exclaimed the Devi.

_*YASMINA*_.
You have done well. And I will tell you why I have given these orders. My brother--

she faltered, choking, and the governor bowed his head, with the customary gesture of respect for a departed sovereign.

_*YASMINA*_.
The king of Vendhya was destroyed by magic,

she said at last.

_*YASMINA*_.
I have devoted my life to the destruction of his murderers. As he died he gave me a clue, and I have followed it. I have read the *Book of Skelos*, and talked with nameless hermits in the caves below Jhelai. I learned how, and by whom, he was destroyed. His enemies were the Black Seers of Mount Yimsha.

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
Asura!

whispered Chunder Shan, paling.

Her eyes knifed him through.

_*YASMINA*_.
Do you fear them?

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
Who does not, Your Majesty?

he replied.

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
They are black devils, haunting the uninhabited hills beyond the Zhaibar. But the sages say that they seldom interfere in the lives of mortal men.

_*YASMINA*_.
Why they slew my brother I do not know,

she answered.

_*YASMINA*_.
But I have sworn on the altar of Asura to destroy them! And I need the aid of a man beyond the border. A Kshatriya army, unaided, would never reach Yimsha.

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
Aye,

muttered Chunder Shan.

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
You speak the truth there. It would be fight every step of the way, with hairy hill-men hurling down boulders from every height, and rushing us with their long knives in every valley. The Turanians fought their way through the Himelians once, but how many returned to Khurusun? Few of those who escaped the swords of the Kshatriyas, after the king, your brother, defeated their host on the Jhumda River, ever saw Secunderam again.

_*YASMINA*_.
And so I must control men across the border,

she said,

_*YASMINA*_.
men who know the way to Mount Yimsha--

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
But the tribes fear the Black Seers and shun the unholy mountain,

broke in the governor.

_*YASMINA*_.
Does the chief, Conan, fear them?

she asked.

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
Well, as to that,

muttered the governor,

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
I doubt if there is anything that devil fears.

_*YASMINA*_.
So I have been told. Therefore he is the man I must deal with. He wishes the release of his seven men. Very well; their ransom shall be the heads of the Black Seers!

Her voice thrummed with hate as she uttered the last words, and her hands clenched at her sides. She looked an image of incarnate passion as she stood there with her head thrown high and her bosom heaving.

Again the governor knelt, for part of his wisdom was the knowledge that a woman in such an emotional tempest is as perilous as a blind cobra to any about her.

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
It shall be as you wish, Your Majesty.

Then as she presented a calmer aspect, he rose and ventured to drop a word of warning.

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
I can not predict what the chief Conan's action will be. The tribesmen are always turbulent, and I have reason to believe that emissaries from the Turanians are stirring them up to raid our borders. As your majesty knows, the Turanians have established themselves in Secunderam and other northern cities, though the hill tribes remain unconquered. King Yezdigerd has long looked southward with greedy lust and perhaps is seeking to gain by treachery what he could not win by force of arms. I have thought that Conan might well be one of his spies.

_*YASMINA*_.
We shall see,

she answered.

_*YASMINA*_.
If he loves his followers, he will be at the gates at dawn, to parley. I shall spend the night in the fortress. I came in disguise to Peshkhauri, and lodged my retinue at an inn instead of the palace. Besides my people, only yourself knows of my presence here.

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
I shall escort you to your quarters, Your Majesty,

said the governor, and as they emerged from the doorway, he beckoned the warrior on guard there, and the man fell in behind them, spear held at salute.

The maid waited, veiled like her mistress, outside the door, and the group traversed a wide, winding corridor, lighted by smoky torches, and reached the quarters reserved for visiting notables--generals and viceroys, mostly; none of the royal family had ever honored the fortress before. Chunder Shan had a perturbed feeling that the suite was not suitable to such an exalted personage as the Devi, and though she sought to make him feel at ease in her presence, he was glad when she dismissed him and he bowed himself out. All the menials of the fort had been summoned to serve his royal guest--though he did not divulge her identity--and he stationed a squad of spearmen before her doors, among them the warrior who had guarded his own chamber. In his preoccupation he forgot to replace the man.

The governor had not been long gone from her when Yasmina suddenly remembered something else which she had wished to discuss with him, but had forgotten until that moment. It concerned the past actions of one Kerim Shah, a nobleman from Iranistan, who had dwelt for a while in Peshkhauri before coming on to the court at Ayodhya. A vague suspicion concerning the man had been stirred by a glimpse of him in Peshkhauri that night. She wondered if he had followed her from Ayodhya. Being a truly remarkable Devi, she did not summon the governor to her again, but hurried out into the corridor alone, and hastened toward his chamber.

*       *       *       *       *

Chunder Shan, entering his chamber, closed the door and went to his table. There he took the letter he had been writing and tore it to bits. Scarcely had he finished when he heard something drop softly onto the parapet adjacent to the window. He looked up to see a figure loom briefly against the stars, and then a man dropped lightly into the room. The light glinted on a long sheen of steel in his hand.

_*CONAN*_.
Shhhh!

he warned.

_*CONAN*_.
Don't make a noise, or I'll send the devil a henchman!

The governor checked his motion toward the sword on the table. He was within reach of the yard-long Zhaibar knife that glittered in the intruder's fist, and he knew the desperate quickness of a hillman.

The invader was a tall man, at once strong and supple. He was dressed like a hillman, but his dark features and blazing blue eyes did not match his garb. Chunder Shan had never seen a man like him; he was not an Easterner, but some barbarian from the West. But his aspect was as untamed and formidable as any of the hairy tribesmen who haunt the hills of Ghulistan.

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
You come like a thief in the night,

commented the governor, recovering some of his composure, although he remembered that there was no guard within call. Still, the hillman could not know that.

_*CONAN*_.
I climbed a bastion,

snarled the intruder.

_*CONAN*_.
A guard thrust his head over the battlement in time for me to rap it with my knife-hilt.

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
You are Conan?

_*CONAN*_.
Who else? You sent word into the hills that you wished for me to come and parley with you. Well, by Crom, I've come! Keep away from that table or I'll gut you.

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
I merely wish to seat myself,

answered the governor, carefully sinking into the ivory chair, which he wheeled away from the table. Conan moved restlessly before him, glancing suspiciously at the door, thumbing the razor edge of his three-foot knife. He did not walk like an Afghuli, and was bluntly direct where the East is subtle.

_*CONAN*_.
You have seven of my men,

he said abruptly.

_*CONAN*_.
You refused the ransom I offered. What the devil do you want?

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
Let us discuss terms,

answered Chunder Shan cautiously.

_*CONAN*_.
Terms?

There was a timbre of dangerous anger in his voice.

_*CONAN*_.
What do you mean? Haven't I offered you gold?

Chunder Shan laughed.

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
Gold? There is more gold in Peshkhauri than you ever saw.

_*CONAN*_.
You're a liar,

retorted Conan.

_*CONAN*_.
I've seen the *suk* of the goldsmiths in Khurusun.

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
Well, more than an Afghuli ever saw,

amended Chunder Shan.

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
And it is but a drop of all the treasure of Vendhya. Why should we desire gold? It would be more to our advantage to hang these seven thieves.

Conan ripped out a sulfurous oath and the long blade quivered in his grip as the muscles rose in ridges on his brown arm.

_*CONAN*_.
I'll split your head like a ripe melon!

A wild blue flame flickered in the hillman's eyes, but Chunder Shan shrugged his shoulders, though keeping an eye on the keen steel.

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
You can kill me easily, and probably escape over the wall afterward. But that would not save the seven tribesmen. My men would surely hang them. And these men are headmen among the Afghulis.

_*CONAN*_.
I know it,

snarled Conan.

_*CONAN*_.
The tribe is baying like wolves at my heels because I have not procured their release. Tell me in plain words what you want, because, by Crom! if there's no other way, I'll raise a horde and lead it to the very gates of Peshkhauri!

Looking at the man as he stood squarely, knife in fist and eyes glaring, Chunder Shan did not doubt that he was capable of it. The governor did not believe any hill-horde could take Peshkhauri, but he did not wish a devastated countryside.

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
There is a mission you must perform,

he said, choosing his words with as much care as if they had been razors.

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
There--

Conan had sprung back, wheeling to face the door at the same instant, lips asnarl. His barbarian ears had caught the quick tread of soft slippers outside the door. The next instant the door was thrown open and a slim, silk-robed form entered hastily, pulling the door shut--then stopping short at sight of the hillman.

Chunder Shan sprang up, his heart jumping into his mouth.

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
Devi!

he cried involuntarily, losing his head momentarily in his fright.

_*CONAN*_.
*Devi!*

It was like an explosive echo from the hillman's lips. Chunder Shan saw recognition and intent flame up in the fierce blue eyes.

The governor shouted desperately and caught at his sword, but the hillman moved with the devastating speed of a hurricane. He sprang, knocked the governor sprawling with a savage blow of his knife-hilt, swept up the astounded Devi in one brawny arm and leaped for the window. Chunder Shan, struggling frantically to his feet, saw the man poise an instant on the sill in a flutter of silken skirts and white limbs that was his royal captive, and heard his fierce, exultant snarl:

_*CONAN*_.
*Now* dare to hang my men!

and then Conan leaped to the parapet and was gone. A wild scream floated back to the governor's ears.

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
Guard! *Guard!*

screamed the governor, struggling up and running drunkenly to the door. He tore it open and reeled into the hall. His shouts re-echoed along the corridors, and warriors came running, gaping to see the governor holding his broken head, from which the blood streamed.

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
Turn out the lancers!

he roared.

_*CHUNDER SHAN*_.
There has been an abduction!

Even in his frenzy he had enough sense left to withhold the full truth. He stopped short as he heard a sudden drum of hoofs outside, a frantic scream and a wild yell of barbaric exultation.

Followed by the bewildered guardsmen, the governor raced for the stair. In the courtyard of the fort a force of lancers stood by saddled steeds, ready to ride at an instant's notice. Chunder Shan led his squadron flying after the fugitive, though his head swam so he had to hold with both hands to the saddle. He did not divulge the identity of the victim, but said merely that the noblewoman who had borne the royal signet-ring had been carried away by the chief of the Afghulis. The abductor was out of sight and hearing, but they knew the path he would strike--the road that runs straight to the mouth of the Zhaibar. There was no moon; peasant huts rose dimly in the starlight. Behind them fell away the grim bastion of the fort, and the towers of Peshkhauri. Ahead of them loomed the black walls of the Himelians.

## 3 Khemsa Uses Magic ##

In the confusion that reigned in the fortress while the guard was being turned out, no one noticed that the girl who had accompanied the Devi slipped out the great arched gate and vanished in the darkness. She ran straight for the city, her garments tucked high. She did not follow the open road, but cut straight through fields and over slopes, avoiding fences and leaping irrigation ditches as surely as if it were broad daylight, and as easily as if she were a trained masculine runner. The hoof-drum of the guardsmen had faded away up the hill before she reached the city wall. She did not go to the great gate, beneath whose arch men leaned on spears and craned their necks into the darkness, discussing the unwonted activity about the fortress. She skirted the wall until she reached a certain point where the spire of the tower was visible above the battlements. Then she placed her hands to her mouth and voiced a low weird call that carried strangely.

Almost instantly a head appeared at an embrasure and a rope came wriggling down the wall. She seized it, placed a foot in the loop at the end, and waved her arm. Then quickly and smoothly she was drawn up the sheer stone curtain. An instant later she scrambled over the merlons and stood up on a flat roof which covered a house that was built against the wall. There was an open trap there, and a man in a camel-hair robe who silently coiled the rope, not showing in any way the strain of hauling a full-grown woman up a forty-foot wall.

_*GITARA*_
Where is Kerim Shah? _(she gasped, panting after her long run.)_

_*KHEMSA*_
Asleep in the house below. You have news?

_*GITARA*_
Conan has stolen the Devi out of the fortress and carried her away into the hills! _(She blurted out her news in a rush, the words stumbling over one another.)_

Khemsa showed no emotion, but merely nodded his turbaned head.

_*KHEMSA*_
Kerim Shah will be glad to hear that, _(he said.)_

_*GITARA*_
Wait! _(The girl threw her supple arms about his neck.)_ She was panting hard, but not only from exertion. Her eyes blazed like black jewels in the starlight. Her upturned face was close to Khemsa's, but though he submitted to her embrace, he did not return it.

_*GITARA*_
Do not tell the Hyrkanian! _(she panted.)_ Let us use this knowledge ourselves! The governor has gone into the hills with his riders, but he might as well chase a ghost. He has not told anyone that it was the Devi who was kidnapped. None in Peshkhauri or the fort knows it except us.

_*KHEMSA*_
But what good does it do us? _(the man expostulated.)_ My masters sent me with Kerim Shah to aid him in every way--

_*GITARA*_
Aid yourself! _(she cried fiercely.)_ Shake off your yoke!

_*KHEMSA*_
You mean--disobey my masters? _(he gasped, and she felt his whole body turn cold under her arms.)_

_*GITARA*_
Aye! _(she shook him in the fury of her emotion.)_ You too are a magician! Why will you be a slave, using your powers only to elevate others? Use your arts for yourself!

_*KHEMSA*_
That is forbidden! _(He was shaking as if with an ague.)_ I am not one of the Black Circle. Only by the command of the masters do I dare to use the knowledge they have taught me.

_*GITARA*_
But you *can* use it! _(she argued passionately.)_ Do as I beg you! Of course Conan has taken the Devi to hold as hostage against the seven tribesmen in the governor's prison. Destroy them, so Chunder Shan can not use them to buy back the Devi. Then let us go into the mountains and take her from the Afghulis. They can not stand against your sorcery with their knives. The treasure of the Vendhyan kings will be ours as ransom--and then when we have it in our hands, we can trick them, and sell her to the king of Turan. We shall have wealth beyond our maddest dreams. With it we can buy warriors. We will take Khorbhul, oust the Turanians from the hills, and send our hosts southward; become king and queen of an empire!

Khemsa too was panting, shaking like a leaf in her grasp; his face showed gray in the starlight, beaded with great drops of perspiration.

_*GITARA*_
I love you! _(she cried fiercely, writhing her body against his, almost strangling him in her wild embrace, shaking him in her abandon.)_ I will make a king of you! For love of you I betrayed my mistress; for love of me betray your masters! Why fear the Black Seers? By your love for me you have broken one of their laws already! Break the rest! You are as strong as they!

A man of ice could not have withstood the searing heat of her passion and fury.

_*KHEMSA*_
I'll do it! _(His voice was thick with laboring emotions. He staggered like a drunken man.)_ The arts they have taught me shall work for me, not for my masters. We shall be rulers of the world--of the world--

_*GITARA*_
Come then! _(Twisting lithely out of his embrace, she seized his hand and led him toward the trap-door.)_ First we must make sure that the governor does not exchange those seven Afghulis for the Devi.

He moved like a man in a daze, until they had descended a ladder and she paused in the chamber below. Kerim Shah lay on a couch motionless, an arm across his face as though to shield his sleeping eyes from the soft light of a brass lamp. She plucked Khemsa's arm and made a quick gesture across her own throat.

Khemsa lifted his hand; then his expression changed and he drew away.

_*KHEMSA*_
I have eaten his salt, _(he muttered.)_ Besides, he can not interfere with us.

He led the girl through a door that opened on a winding stair. After their soft tread had faded into silence, the man on the couch sat up.

Kerim Shah wiped the sweat from his face. A knife-thrust he did not dread, but he feared Khemsa as a man fears a poisonous reptile.

_*KERIM SHAH*_
People who plot on roofs should remember to lower their voices, _(he muttered.)_ But as Khemsa has turned against his masters, and as he was my only contact between them, I can count on their aid no longer. From now on I play the game in my own way.

Rising to his feet he went quickly to a table, drew pen and parchment from his girdle and scribbled a few succinct lines.

_*KERIM SHAH*_
To Khosru Khan, governor of Secunderam: the Cimmerian Conan has carried the Devi Yasmina to the villages of the Afghulis. It is an opportunity to get the Devi into our hands, as the king has so long desired. Send three thousand horsemen at once. I will meet them in the valley of Gurashah with native guides.

And he signed it with a name that was not in the least like Kerim Shah.

Then from a golden cage he drew forth a carrier pigeon, to whose leg he made fast the parchment, rolled into a tiny cylinder and secured with gold wire. Then he went quickly to a casement and tossed the bird into the night. It wavered on fluttering wings, balanced, and was gone like a flitting shadow. Catching up helmet, sword and cloak, Kerim Shah hurried out of the chamber and down the winding stair.

_`BREAK`_
*       *       *       *       *

The prison quarters of Peshkhauri were separated from the rest of the city by a massive wall, in which was set a single iron-bound door under an arch. Over the arch burned a lurid red cresset, and beside the door squatted a warrior with spear and shield.

This warrior, leaning on his spear, and yawning from time to time, started suddenly to his feet. He had not thought he had dozed, but a man was standing before him, a man he had not heard approach. The man wore a camel-hair robe and a green turban. In the flickering light of the cresset his features were shadowy, but a pair of lambent eyes shone surprisingly in the lurid glow.

_*GATE GUARD*_
Who comes? _(demanded the warrior, presenting his spear.)_ Who are you?

The stranger did not seem perturbed, though the spear-point touched his bosom. His eyes held the warrior's with strange intensity.

_*KHEMSA*_
What are you obliged to do? _(he asked, strangely.)_

_*GATE GUARD*_
To guard the gate! _(The warrior spoke thickly and mechanically; he stood rigid as a statue, his eyes slowly glazing.)_

_*KHEMSA*_
You lie! You are obliged to obey me! You have looked into my eyes, and your soul is no longer your own. Open that door!

Stiffly, with the wooden features of an image, the guard wheeled about, drew a great key from his girdle, turned it in the massive lock and swung open the door. Then he stood at attention, his unseeing stare straight ahead of him.

A woman glided from the shadows and laid an eager hand on the mesmerist's arm.

_*GITARA*_
Bid him fetch us horses, Khemsa, _(she whispered.)_

_*KHEMSA*_
No need of that, _(answered the Rakhsha.)_ I have no more use for you. Kill yourself!

Like a man in a trance the warrior thrust the butt of his spear against the base of the wall, and placed the keen head against his body, just below the ribs. Then slowly, stolidly, he leaned against it with all his weight, so that it transfixed his body and came out between his shoulders. Sliding down the shaft he lay still, the spear jutting above him its full length, like a horrible stalk growing out of his back.

The girl stared down at him in morbid fascination, until Khemsa took her arm and led her through the gate. Torches lighted a narrow space between the outer wall and a lower inner one, in which were arched doors at regular intervals. A warrior paced this enclosure, and when the gate opened he came sauntering up, so secure in his knowledge of the prison's strength that he was not suspicious until Khemsa and the girl emerged from the archway. Then it was too late. The Rakhsha did not waste time in hypnotism; the guard lowered his spear threateningly, opening his mouth to shout an alarm. Khemsa flicked the spear aside with his left hand, as a man might flick a straw, and his right flashed out and back, seeming gently to caress the warrior's neck in passing. The guard pitched on his face without a sound, his head lolling on a broken neck.

Khemsa did not glance at him, but went straight to one of the arched doors and placed his open hand against the heavy bronze lock. With a rending shudder the portal buckled inward. The thick teakwood hung in splinters, the bronze bolts bent and twisted, the hinges broken and disjointed.

The broken door let them into a small courtyard lit by a cresset. Opposite the door was a wide grille of iron bars. A hairy hand gripped one of the bars, and behind them glimmered the whites of eyes.

Khemsa stood silent, gazing into the shadows. Then from his opening fingers a shimmering feather of sparkling dust sifted to the flags. Instantly a flare of green fire lighted the enclosure. Seven hairy hill-men stood motionless behind the bars; fear blazed in their eyes.

The flare died, leaving a quivering ball of lambent green. It elongated, spiraling upward into a luminous green smoke. It twisted and writhed like a great shadowy serpent, then broadened into a rolling cloud that drifted silently toward the grille.

The men watched in horror. The cloud enveloped the bars, then oozed through them like fog. A strangled gasp sounded—and then nothing.

Khemsa touched the girl's arm. Mechanically she turned to leave, looking back over her shoulder. Already the mist thinned; she glimpsed sandalled feet, toes upward—seven still shapes.

_*KHEMSA*_
And now for a steed swifter than the fastest horse ever bred in a mortal stable. _(We will be in Afghulistan before dawn.)_
## 4 An Encounter in the Pass ##

Yasmina Devi could never clearly remember the details of her abduction. The unexpectedness and violence stunned her; she had only a confused impression of a whirl of happenings—the terrifying grip of a mighty arm, the blazing eyes of her abductor, and his hot breath burning on her flesh. The leap through the window to the parapet, the mad race across battlements and roofs when the fear of falling froze her, the reckless descent of a rope bound to a merlon—he went down almost at a run, his captive folded limply over his brawny shoulder—all this was a befuddled tangle in the Devi's mind. She retained a more vivid memory of him running fleetly into the shadows of the trees, carrying her like a child, and vaulting into the saddle of a fierce Bhalkhana stallion which reared and snorted. Then there was a sensation of flying, and the racing hoofs were striking sparks of fire from the flinty road as the stallion swept up the slopes.

As the girl's mind cleared, her first sensations were furious rage and shame. She was appalled. The rulers of the golden kingdoms south of the Himelians were considered little short of divine; and she was the Devi of Vendhya! Fright was submerged in regal wrath. She cried out furiously and began struggling. She, Yasmina, to be carried on the saddle-bow of a hill chief, like a common wench of the market-place! He merely hardened his massive thews slightly against her writhings, and for the first time in her life she experienced the coercion of superior physical strength. His arms felt like iron about her slender limbs. He glanced down at her and grinned hugely. His teeth glimmered whitely in the starlight. The reins lay loose on the stallion's flowing mane, and every thew and fiber of the great beast strained as he hurtled along the boulder-strewn trail. But Conan sat easily, almost carelessly, in the saddle, riding like a centaur.

_*YASMINA*_
You hill-bred dog! _(she panted, quivering with the impact of shame, anger, and the realization of helplessness.)_ You dare—you *dare*! Your life shall pay for this! Where are you taking me?

_*CONAN*_
To the villages of Afghulistan. _(He cast a glance over his shoulder.)_

Behind them, beyond the slopes they had traversed, torches were tossing on the walls of the fortress, and he glimpsed a flare of light that meant the great gate had been opened. And he laughed, a deep-throated boom gusty as the hill wind.

_*CONAN*_
The governor has sent his riders after us. By Crom, we will lead him a merry chase! What do you think, Devi—will they pay seven lives for a Kshatriya princess?

_*YASMINA*_
They will send an army to hang you and your spawn of devils, _(she promised with conviction.)_

He laughed gustily and shifted her to a more comfortable position in his arms. But she took this as a fresh outrage, and renewed her vain struggle, until she saw that her efforts were only amusing him. Besides, her light silken garments, floating on the wind, were being outrageously disarranged by her struggles. She concluded that a scornful submission was the better part of dignity, and lapsed into a smoldering quiescence.

She felt even her anger being submerged by awe as they entered the mouth of the Pass, lowering like a black well mouth in the blacker walls that rose like colossal ramparts to bar their way. It was as if a gigantic knife had cut the Zhaibar out of walls of solid rock. On either hand sheer slopes pitched up for thousands of feet, and the mouth of the Pass was dark as hate. Even Conan could not see with any accuracy, but he knew the road, even by night. And knowing that armed men were racing through the starlight after him, he did not check the stallion’s speed.

Not even Conan could spy, in that darkness, an ambush set by Zhaibar tribesmen. As they swept past a black gorge mouth, a javelin swished through the air and thudded home behind the stallion’s shoulder. The beast died with a sob. Conan leaped clear, holding Yasmina aloft, landed catlike, thrust her into a cleft of rock, and wheeled toward the darkness, drawing his knife.

A vague shape rushed from the night, bare feet slapping, rags whipping. Steel flickered; stroke, parry, counter-stroke cracked in the dark. Conan’s knife split the attacker’s skull.

Out in the night men were moving and a stentorian voice roared:

_*UNKNOWN WAZULI*_
What, you dogs! Do you flinch? In, curse you, and take them!

Conan started, peered into the darkness and lifted his voice.

_*CONAN*_
Yar Afzal! Is it you?

A startled imprecation answered him, then:

_*YAR AFZAL*_
Conan? Is it you, Conan?

_*CONAN*_
Aye! Come forth, you old war-dog. I've slain one of your men.

There was movement among the rocks, and a flame bobbed toward them, lighting a fierce bearded face. More wild, ragged men pressed close, blades in fists.

_*YAR AFZAL*_
Aye, it is Conan! Come out of your rocks, dogs! It is Conan!

'What are you hunting in the Zhaibar by night, Yar Afzal?' Conan demanded.

_*YAR AFZAL*_
Who knows what might come up the Pass after dark? We Wazulis are night-hawks. But what of you, Conan?

_*CONAN*_
I have a prisoner. _(He moved aside and drew Yasmina forth.)_

Her imperious bearing gone, she cowered. The torch thrust near her face drew hissing breaths.

_*CONAN*_
She is my captive. _(He glanced at the slain man’s feet.)_ I was taking her to Afghulistan, but now you have slain my horse, and the Kshatriyas are close behind me.

_*YAR AFZAL*_
Come with us to my village. We have horses hidden in the gorge. They can never follow us in the darkness. They are close behind you, you say?

_*CONAN*_
So close that I hear now the clink of their hoofs on the flint.

Instantly the torch was dashed out and the shapes melted into the dark. Conan swept up the Devi and she did not resist…

They reached the gorge mouth, where horses stirred. Conan mounted the horse of the man he had slain, lifting the girl in front of him, and the band swept away like phantoms.

Yasmina, snuggled warmly in his arms, grew drowsy. Darkness, stars, vast walls, winds of dizzy heights, clink of hoofs, creak of saddles—all blurred into dream.

She vaguely felt being lifted down, laid on something soft, a cloak tucked around her.

_*YAR AFZAL*_
A rare prize, Conan; fit mate for a chief of the Afghulis.

_*CONAN*_
Not for me. This wench will buy the lives of my seven headmen, blast their souls.

She sank into dreamless slumber.

She slept while armed men rode through the dark hills and the fate of kingdoms hung in the balance…

A band of riders waited in a black pitmouth of a gorge. Their leader, a well-built man in a helmet and gilt-braided cloak, raised his hand until hoofbeats passed.

_*LEADER*_
They must have lost the trail! Or else they have found that Conan has already reached the Afghuli villages. It will take many riders to smoke out that hive. There will be squadrons riding up the Zhaibar by dawn.

_*IRAKZAI RIDER*_
If there is fighting in the hills there will be looting.

_*LEADER*_
There will be looting. But first it is our business to reach the valley of Gurashah and await the riders galloping southward from Secunderam before daylight.

He lifted his reins and rode out, his men falling in behind him—thirty ragged phantoms in the starlight.
## 5 The Black Stallion ##

The sun was well up when Yasmina awoke. She did not start and stare blankly, wondering where she was. She awoke with full knowledge of all that had occurred. Her supple limbs were stiff from her long ride, and her firm flesh seemed to feel the contact of the muscular arm that had borne her so far.

She was lying on a sheepskin covering a pallet of leaves on a hard-beaten dirt floor. A folded sheepskin coat was under her head, and she was wrapped in a ragged cloak. She was in a large room, the walls of which were crudely but strongly built of uncut rocks, plastered with sun-baked mud. Heavy beams supported a roof of the same kind, in which showed a trap-door up to which led a ladder. There were no windows in the thick walls, only loop-holes. There was one door, a sturdy bronze affair that must have been looted from some Vendhyan border tower. Opposite it was a wide opening in the wall, with no door, but several strong wooden bars in place. Beyond them Yasmina saw a magnificent black stallion munching a pile of dried grass. The building was fort, dwelling-place and stable in one.

At the other end of the room a girl in the vest and baggy trousers of a hill-woman squatted beside a small fire, cooking strips of meat on an iron grid laid over blocks of stone. There was a sooty cleft in the wall a few feet from the floor, and some of the smoke found its way out there. The rest floated in blue wisps about the room.

The hill-girl glanced at Yasmina over her shoulder, displaying a bold, handsome face, and then continued her cooking. Voices boomed outside; then the door was kicked open, and Conan strode in. He looked more enormous than ever with the morning sunlight behind him, and Yasmina noted some details that had escaped her the night before. His garments were clean and not ragged. The broad Bakhariot girdle that supported his knife in its ornamented scabbard would have matched the robes of a prince, and there was a glint of fine Turanian mail under his shirt.

_*WAZULI GIRL*_
Your captive is awake, Conan.

Conan grunted, strode up to the fire and swept the strips of mutton off into a stone dish.

The squatting girl laughed up at him, with some spicy jest, and he grinned wolfishly, and hooking a toe under her haunches, tumbled her sprawling onto the floor. She seemed to derive considerable amusement from this bit of rough horse-play, but Conan paid no more heed to her. Producing a great hunk of bread from somewhere, with a copper jug of wine, he carried the lot to Yasmina, who had risen from her pallet and was regarding him doubtfully.

_*CONAN*_
Rough fare for a Devi, girl, but our best. It will fill your belly, at least.

He set the platter on the floor, and she was suddenly aware of a ravenous hunger. Making no comment, she seated herself cross-legged on the floor, and taking the dish in her lap, she began to eat. After all, adaptability is one of the tests of true aristocracy. Conan stood looking down at her, his thumbs hooked in his girdle. He never sat cross-legged, after the Eastern fashion.

_*YASMINA*_
Where am I?

_*CONAN*_
In the hut of Yar Afzal, the chief of the Khurum Wazulis. Afghulistan lies a good many miles farther on to the west. We'll hide here awhile. The Kshatriyas are beating up the hills for you—several of their squads have been cut up by the tribes already.

_*YASMINA*_
What are you going to do?

_*CONAN*_
Keep you until Chunder Shan is willing to trade back my seven cow-thieves. Women of the Wazulis are crushing ink out of *shoki* leaves, and after a while you can write a letter to the governor.

A touch of her old imperious wrath shook her. She flung down the dish and sprang to her feet, tense with anger.

_*YASMINA*_
I will not write a letter! If you do not take me back, they will hang your seven men, and a thousand more besides!

The Wazuli girl laughed mockingly. Conan scowled. Then the door opened and Yar Afzal came swaggering in. The Wazuli chief was as tall as Conan, and of greater girth, but he looked fat and slow beside the hard compactness of the Cimmerian. He plucked his red-stained beard and stared meaningly at the Wazuli girl, and that wench rose and scurried out. Then Yar Afzal turned to his guest.

_*YAR AFZAL*_
The damnable people murmur, Conan. They wish me to murder you and take the girl to hold for ransom. They say that anyone can tell by her garments that she is a noble lady. They say why should the Afghuli dogs profit by her, when it is the people who take the risk of guarding her?

_*CONAN*_
Lend me your horse. I'll take her and go.

_*YAR AFZAL*_
Pish! Do you think I can't handle my own people? I'll have them dancing in their shirts if they cross me! They don't love you—or any other outlander—but you saved my life once. Come out, though, Conan; a scout has returned.

Conan followed him outside. Yasmina peered through a loop-hole.

A Wazuli scout sat cross-legged before the circle of warriors.

_*SCOUT*_
I talked with a Dagozai who saw the riders last night. He was lurking near when they came to the spot where we ambushed the lord Conan. He overheard their speech. Chunder Shan was with them. They found the dead horse, and one of the men recognized it as Conan's. Then they found the man Conan slew, and knew him for a Wazuli. It seemed to them that Conan had been slain and the girl taken by the Wazuli; so they turned aside from their purpose of following to Afghulistan. But they did not know from which village the dead man was come, and we had left no trail a Kshatriya could follow.

So they rode to the nearest Wazuli village, Jugra, and burnt it and slew many. But the men of Khojur fell upon them and slew some, wounding the governor. They retired down the Zhaibar before dawn, returned with reinforcements before sunrise, and there has been fighting in the hills all morning. A great army is being raised to sweep the hills. Moreover, Kerim Shah has returned to the hills.

Yasmina leaned closer at that name.

_*YAR AFZAL*_
Where went he?

_*SCOUT*_
The Dagozai did not know. With him were thirty Irakzai of the lower villages. They rode into the hills and disappeared.

_*YAR AFZAL*_
These Irakzai are jackals that follow a lion for crumbs. They lap up the coins Kerim Shah scatters to buy men like horses. I like him not, for all he is our kinsman from Iranistan.

_*CONAN*_
He's not even that. I know him of old. He's a Hyrkanian, a spy of Yezdigerd's. If I catch him I'll hang his hide to a tamarisk.

_*WARRIORS*_
But the Kshatriyas! Are we to squat on our haunches until they smoke us out?

_*YAR AFZAL*_
Let them come. We can hold the defiles against a host.

One man leaped up, shaking his fist at Conan.

_*AGITATOR*_
Are we to take all the risks while he reaps the rewards? Are we to fight his battles for him?

Conan strode to him, staring full into his face.

_*CONAN*_
I ask no man to fight my battles. Draw your blade if you dare, you yapping dog!

_*AGITATOR*_
Dare to touch me and here are fifty men to rend you apart!

_*YAR AFZAL*_
What! Are you chief of Khurum? Do the Wazulis take orders from Yar Afzal, or from a low-bred cur?

He choked the man, hurled him to the ground, then kicked him savagely.

_*YAR AFZAL*_
Get down the valley to the watchers on the heights and bring word if they have seen anything.

The man went, shaking with fear.

He soon encountered a man in a camel-hair robe and green turban. Their eyes met—  
and froze the Wazuli in his tracks.

After minutes, the man drew a symbol in the dust and a black jade ball appeared. He tossed it to the Wazuli.

_*KHEMSA (UNRECOGNIZED BY WAZULIS)*_
Carry this to Yar Afzal.

The entranced man returned to the village.

Back before the hut, Yar Afzal halted mid-tirade as the man approached silently, arm outstretched, holding the jade ball. Conan murmured a warning, but too late.

Yar Afzal struck the man, the ball rolled to his foot. He picked it up—

—and felt movement in his hand.

He stared, horrified. A bellow of agony burst from him. He fell. A black jade-bodied spider crawled from his fingers and vanished into a crevice.

The tribesmen reeled back.

Then a voice rang out—a command from nowhere:

_*VOICE OF COMMAND*_
Yar Afzal is dead! Kill the outlander!

The Wazulis charged.

Conan sprang for the door. He slew and parried, dragging a dead man inside and slamming the door. Blades hacked at the bronze. A tree trunk smashed against it. The stallion screamed and struck.

Inside, Conan fought a tribesman who had entered with him.

Yasmina ran forward as Conan rose from beneath the corpse.

_*YASMINA*_
Oh, you live! I thought—I thought you were dead!

_*CONAN*_
Why are you trembling? Why should you care if I live or die?

_*YASMINA*_
You are preferable to those wolves howling without.

The door-sill splintered.

Conan tore into the stall, seized the maddened stallion, dragged him down by main strength, bridled and saddled him.

He worked at the stone wall.

_*CONAN*_
A secret door—Yar Afzal showed it to me once when he was drunk. It opens into the ravine behind the hut. Ha!

The wall slid open.

He hauled Yasmina onto the stallion, vaulted up—

—and the Wazulis burst through the door behind them.

The stallion shot through the opening like a javelin.

In the ravine mouth, a man in a green turban was unable to leap aside. He fell under the hoofs. A girl screamed. Conan glimpsed her as they thundered by—a slim, dark girl in silk trousers and a jeweled breast-band.

Then horse and riders vanished up the gorge, and the men who stormed after them met something that changed their yells of blood-lust to screams of fear and death.
## 6 The Mountain of the Black Seers ##

'Where now?' Yasmina was trying to sit erect on the rocking saddle-bow, clutching her captor. She was conscious of a recognition of shame that she should not find unpleasant the feel of his muscular flesh under her fingers.

_*CONAN*_
To Afghulistan. It's a perilous road, but the stallion will carry us easily, unless we fall in with some of your friends, or my tribal enemies. Now that Yar Afzal is dead, those damned Wazulis will be on our heels. I'm surprized we haven't sighted them behind us already.

_*YASMINA*_
Who was that man you rode down?

_*CONAN*_
I don't know. I never saw him before. He's no Ghuli, that's certain. What the devil he was doing there is more than I can say. There was a girl with him, too.

_*YASMINA*_
Yes. _(Her gaze was shadowed.)_ I can not understand that. That girl was my maid, Gitara. Do you suppose she was coming to aid me? That the man was a friend? If so, the Wazulis have captured them both.

_*CONAN*_
Well, there's nothing we can do. If we go back, they'll skin us both. I can't understand how a girl like that could get this far into the mountains with only one man—and he a robed scholar, for that's what he looked like. There's something infernally queer in all this. That fellow Yar Afzal beat and sent away—he moved like a man walking in his sleep. I've seen the priests of Zamora perform their abominable rituals in their forbidden temples, and their victims had a stare like that man. The priests looked into their eyes and muttered incantations, and then the people became the walking dead men, with glassy eyes, doing as they were ordered.

And then I saw what the fellow had in his hand, which Yar Afzal picked up. It was like a big black jade bead, such as the temple girls of Yezud wear when they dance before the black stone spider which is their god. Yar Afzal held it in his hand, and he didn't pick up anything else. Yet when he fell dead, a spider, like the god at Yezud, only smaller, ran out of his fingers. And then, when the Wazulis stood uncertain there, a voice cried out for them to kill me, and I know that voice didn't come from any of the warriors, nor from the women who watched by the huts. It seemed to come from *above*.

Yasmina did not reply. She glanced at the stark outlines of the mountains all about them and shuddered. Her soul shrank from their gaunt brutality. This was a grim, naked land where anything might happen. Age-old traditions invested it with shuddery horror for anyone born in the hot, luxuriant southern plains.

The sun was high, beating down with fierce heat, yet the wind that blew in fitful gusts seemed to sweep off slopes of ice. Once she heard a strange rushing above them that was not the sweep of the wind, and from the way Conan looked up, she knew it was not a common sound to him, either. She thought that a strip of the cold blue sky was momentarily blurred, as if some all but invisible object had swept between it and herself, but she could not be sure. Neither made any comment, but Conan loosened his knife in his scabbard.

They were following a faintly marked path dipping down into ravines so deep the sun never struck bottom, laboring up steep slopes where loose shale threatened to slide from beneath their feet, and following knife-edge ridges with blue-hazed echoing depths on either hand.

The sun had passed its zenith when they crossed a narrow trail winding among the crags. Conan reined the horse aside and followed it southward, going almost at right angles to their former course.

_*CONAN*_
A Galzai village is at one end of this trail. Their women follow it to a well, for water. You need new garments.

Glancing down at her filmy attire, Yasmina agreed. Her slippers were in tatters, her silk robes torn.

Coming to a crook in the trail, Conan dismounted, helped her down and waited.

_*CONAN*_
A woman coming along the trail. _(He nodded, though she heard nothing.)_

_*YASMINA*_
You will not—not kill her?

_*CONAN*_
I don't kill women ordinarily; though some of the hill-women are she-wolves. No— _(he grinned as at a huge jest.)_ By Crom, I'll *pay* for her clothes! How is that?

Presently a tall, slim Galzai girl appeared, bearing a great empty gourd. She froze, then stood still in fear.

Conan displayed the gold coin.

_*CONAN*_
If you will give this woman your garments, I will give you this money.

The girl instantly stripped herself and handed her garments to Conan. He passed them to Yasmina.

_*CONAN*_
Get behind that rock and put these on. Fold your robes into a bundle and bring them to me.

_*GALZAI GIRL*_
The money! _(she clamored, stretching out her hands.)_ The gold you promised me!

Conan flipped the coin to her; she bit it and went on down the path with her gourd.

Yasmina dressed behind the rock. When she emerged, Conan swore in amazement and stared with burning admiration.

He turned her about, staring from all angles.

_*CONAN*_
By Crom! In those smoky, mystic robes you were aloof and cold and far off as a star! Now you are a woman of warm flesh and blood! You went behind that rock as the Devi of Vendhya; you come out as a hill-girl—though a thousand times more beautiful than any wench of the Zhaibar! You were a goddess—now you are real!

He spanked her, and she did not feel outraged.

He hurled the bundle of her robes over a cliff into a gorge.

_*YASMINA*_
Why did you do that? Why did you not give them to the girl?

_*CONAN*_
The riders from Peshkhauri are combing these hills. If they found a girl wearing your garments, they’d torture her into talking, and she might put them on my trail.

_*YASMINA*_
What will she do?

_*CONAN*_
Go back to her village and tell her people that a stranger attacked her. She’ll have them on our track. But she had to get the water first; if she dared go back without it, they’d whip the skin off her. That gives us a long start. They'll never catch us. By nightfall we'll cross the Afghuli border.

_*YASMINA*_
There are no paths or signs of human habitation in these parts. Even for the Himelians this region seems deserted.

Conan pointed northwest, where a peak appeared in a notch of the crags.

_*CONAN*_
Yimsha. The tribes build their villages as far as they can from the mountain.

_*YASMINA*_
Yimsha! The mountain of the Black Seers!

_*CONAN*_
So they say. This is as near as I ever came. I swung north to avoid Kshatriya troops. The regular trail lies farther south. This is an ancient one, seldom used.

She stared at the peak with hatred.

_*YASMINA*_
How long would it take to reach Yimsha from this point?

_*CONAN*_
All the rest of the day, and all night. Do you want to go there? By Crom, it's no place for ordinary humans, from what the hill-people say.

_*YASMINA*_
Why do they not gather and destroy the devils that inhabit it?

_*CONAN*_
Wipe out wizards with swords? Anyway, they never interfere unless people meddle with them. I've talked with men who swore they'd glimpsed tall silent men in black robes at sunrise or sunset.

_*YASMINA*_
Would you be afraid to attack them?

_*CONAN*_
I? If they imposed on me, it would be my life or theirs. But I have nothing to do with them. I came here to raise a following of human beings, not to war with wizards.

She considered this, staring at the peak. She stiffened suddenly and pointed.

_*YASMINA*_
Look!

A frosty crimson cloud veined with gold hovered over the peak, rotating, contracting, then detaching itself to float out and vanish.

_*YASMINA*_
What could that have been?

_*CONAN*_
The hill-men call it Yimsha's Carpet, whatever that means. I've seen five hundred of them run to hide in caves because they saw that crimson cloud float up—

They emerged onto a broad ledge. The stallion halted, refusing to advance.

Conan dismounted, tried to lead the horse; it neighed and jerked back.

Then Yasmina cried out. A man in a camel-hair robe and green turban stood there. Conan recognized him.

_*CONAN*_
Who the devil are you?

The man did not answer. His wide, luminous eyes held Conan's.

Conan felt the hypnotic force—but shook it off.

He lunged with his knife. Yasmina did not see how Khemsa avoided the blow. Conan went down like an ox.

Conan slashed upward even as he fell, forcing Khemsa to leap back.

Yasmina cried out as Gitara emerged. The malevolence in Gitara’s beautiful face froze her heart.

Conan rose slowly, shaken. Khemsa watched him warily, perhaps uncertain for the first time.

Then all froze, staring upward.

A crimson conoid cloud whirled down the mountain.

Khemsa trembled; his hand dropped; he pushed Gitara back.

The cloud struck the ledge—  
and vanished.

Four tall, shaven-headed men in black robes stood where it had been.

Conan backed to the stallion; Yasmina crept into his arm.

The men stared silently at Khemsa. He shook like a man in an ague, sweat streaming. His fingers dug into Gitara’s shoulder.

Khemsa fought the four titanic wills with all the black power they had taught him. He reeled but held.

Gitara was his anchor to humanity—  
and they knew it.

One shifted his gaze to her. She wilted. Her eyes glassy, she backed toward the precipice.

Khemsa staggered after her, divided and doomed.

She reached the brink.

He crawled toward her.

A wizard laughed.

Reason flooded back into Gitara’s eyes—terrified, pleading—  
and she fell with a moaning cry.

Khemsa stared over the edge, then turned on his tormentors.

He rushed with a knife.

A wizard stamped his foot.

A crevice split the ledge. A section sheared away.

Khemsa vanished with the avalanche.

The wizards turned toward Conan.

He moved sluggishly, befogged.

The four raised their arms; crimson smoke rose around them.

It enveloped Conan.

Yasmina screamed; the stallion shrieked.

She was torn from his arm.

A terrific blow hurled Conan against a rock.

A crimson cloud spun away up the slopes—  
and Yasmina was gone.
## 7: On to Yimsha ##

As mists vanish before a strong wind, the cobwebs vanished from Conan’s brain. With a searing curse he leaped into the saddle and the stallion reared neighing beneath him. He glared up the slopes, hesitated, and then turned down the trail in the direction he had been going when halted by Khemsa’s trickery. But now he did not ride at a measured gait. He shook loose the reins and the stallion went like a thunderbolt, as if frantic to lose hysteria in violent physical exertion. Across the ledge and around the crag and down the narrow trail threading the great steep they plunged at breakneck speed. The path followed a fold of rock, winding interminably down from tier to tier of striated escarpment, and once, far below, Conan got a glimpse of the ruin that had fallen—a mighty pile of broken stone and boulders at the foot of a gigantic cliff.

The valley floor was still far below him when he reached a long and lofty ridge that led out from the slope like a natural causeway. Out upon this he rode, with an almost sheer drop on either hand. He could trace ahead of him the trail and made a great horseshoe back into the river-bed at his left hand. He cursed the necessity of traversing those miles, but it was the only way. To try to descend to the lower lap of the trail here would be to attempt the impossible. Only a bird could get to the river-bed with a whole neck.

So he urged on the wearying stallion, until a clink of hoofs reached his ears, welling up from below. Pulling up short and reining to the lip of the cliff, he stared down into the dry river-bed that wound along the foot of the ridge. Along that gorge rode a motley throng—bearded men on half-wild horses, five hundred strong, bristling with weapons. And Conan shouted suddenly, leaning over the edge of the cliff, three hundred feet above them.

At his shout they reined back, and five hundred bearded faces were tilted up towards him; a deep, clamorous roar filled the canyon. Conan did not waste words.

_*CONAN*_
‘I was riding for Ghor!’ he roared. ‘I had not hoped to meet you dogs on the trail. Follow me as fast as your nags can push! I’m going to Yimsha, and—’

_*AFGHULI WARRIOR*_
‘Traitor!’

_*CONAN*_
‘What?’

He glared down at them, jolted speechless. He saw wild eyes blazing up at him, faces contorted with fury, fists brandishing blades.

_*AFGHULI WARRIOR*_
‘Traitor! Where are the seven chiefs held captive in Peshkhauri?’

_*CONAN*_
‘Why, in the governor’s prison, I suppose.’

A bloodthirsty yell from a hundred throats answered him, with such a waving of weapons and a clamor that he could not understand what they were saying. He beat down the din with a bull-like roar.

_*CONAN*_
‘What devil’s play is this? Let one of you speak, so I can understand what you mean!’

_*AFGHULI WARRIOR*_
‘You would not let us go raiding Peshkhauri to rescue our brothers!’

_*CONAN*_
‘No, you fools! Even if you’d breached the wall, which is unlikely, they’d have hanged the prisoners before you could reach them.’

_*AFGHULI WARRIOR*_
‘And you went alone to traffic with the governor!’

_*CONAN*_
‘Well?’

_*AFGHULI WARRIOR*_
‘Where are the seven chiefs? Dead!’

_*CONAN*_
‘What!’

_*AFGHULI WARRIOR*_
‘Aye, dead!’

_*AFGHULI WARRIOR*_
‘They were not hanged! A Wazuli in another cell saw them die! The governor sent a wizard to slay them by craft!’

_*CONAN*_
‘That must be a lie. The governor would not dare. Last night I talked with him—’

A yell of hate and accusation split the skies.

_*AFGHULI WARRIOR*_
‘Aye! You went to him alone! To betray us! It is no lie. The Wazuli escaped and told the tale to our scouts. When they heard it, they returned with all haste to Ghor—and we saddled our steeds and girt our swords!’

_*CONAN*_
‘And what do you fools mean to do?’

_*AFGHULI WARRIOR*_
‘To avenge our brothers! Death to the Kshatriyas! Slay him, brothers—he is a traitor!’

Arrows began to rattle around him. Conan rose in his stirrups, striving to make himself heard above the tumult; and then, with a roar of mingled rage, defiance and disgust, he wheeled and galloped back up the trail.

Behind him and below him the Afghulis came pelting, mouthing their rage, too furious even to remember that the only way they could reach the height whereon he rode was to traverse the river-bed in the other direction, make the broad bend, and follow the twisting trail up over the ridge. When they did remember this, and turned back, their repudiated chief had almost reached the point where the ridge joined the escarpment.

At the cliff he did not take the trail by which he had descended, but turned off on another, a mere trace along a rock-fault, where the stallion scrambled for footing. He had not ridden far when the stallion snorted and shied back from something lying in the trail. Conan stared down on the travesty of a man, a broken, shredded, bloody heap that gibbered and gnashed splintered teeth.

Impelled by some obscure reason, Conan dismounted and stood looking down at the ghastly shape, knowing that he was witness of a thing miraculous and opposed to nature. The Rakhsha lifted his gory head, and his strange eyes, glazed with agony and approaching death, rested on Conan with recognition.

_*KHEMSA*_
'Where are they?' It was a racking croak not even remotely resembling a human voice.

_*CONAN*_
'Gone back to their damnable castle on Yimsha. They took the Devi with them.'

_*KHEMSA*_
'I will go! I will follow them! They killed Gitara; I will kill them—the acolytes, the Four of the Black Circle, the Master himself! Kill—kill them all!'

'He strove to drag his mutilated frame along the rock, but not even his indomitable will could animate that gory mass longer, where the splintered bones hung together only by torn tissue and ruptured fibre.'

_*KHEMSA*_
'Follow them! Follow!'

_*CONAN*_
'I'm going to. I went to fetch my Afghulis, but they've turned on me. I'm going on to Yimsha alone. I'll have the Devi back if I have to tear down that damned mountain with my bare hands. I didn't think the governor would dare kill my headmen, when I had the Devi, but it seems he did. I'll have his head for that. She's no use to me now as a hostage, but—'

_*KHEMSA*_
'The curse of Yizil on them! Go! I am dying. Wait—take my girdle.'

He tried to fumble with a mangled hand at his tatters, and Conan, understanding what he sought to convey, bent and drew from about his gory waist a girdle of curious aspect.

_*KHEMSA*_
'Follow the golden vein through the abyss. Wear the girdle. I had it from a Stygian priest. It will aid you, though it failed me at last. Break the crystal globe with the four golden pomegranates. Beware of the Master's transmutations— I am going to Gitara—she is waiting for me in hell—*aie, ya Skelos yar!*'

And so he died.

Conan stared down at the girdle. The hair of which it was woven was not horsehair. He was convinced that it was woven of the thick black tresses of a woman. Set in the thick mesh were tiny jewels such as he had never seen before. The buckle was strangely made, in the form of a golden serpent-head, flat, wedge-shaped and scaled with curious art. A strong shudder shook Conan as he handled it, and he turned as though to cast it over the precipice; then he hesitated, and finally buckled it about his waist, under the Bakhariot girdle. Then he mounted and pushed on.

The sun had sunk behind the crags. He climbed the trail in the vast shadow of the cliffs that was thrown out like a dark blue mantle over valleys and ridges far below. He was not far from the crest when, edging around the shoulder of a jutting crag, he heard the clink of shod hoofs ahead of him. He did not turn back. Indeed, so narrow was the path that the stallion could not have wheeled his great body upon it. He rounded the jut of the rock and came upon a portion of the path that broadened somewhat. A chorus of threatening yells broke on his ear, but his stallion pinned a terrified horse hard against the rock, and Conan caught the arm of the rider in an iron grip, checking the lifted sword in midair.

_*CONAN*_
'Kerim Shah!'

The Turanian did not struggle; they sat their horses almost breast to breast, Conan's fingers locking the other's sword-arm. Behind Kerim Shah filed a group of lean Irakzai on gaunt horses. They glared like wolves, fingering bows and knives, but rendered uncertain because of the narrowness of the path and the perilous proximity of the abyss that yawned beneath them.

_*KERIM SHAH*_
'Where is the Devi?'

_*CONAN*_
'What's it to you, you Hyrkanian spy?'

_*KERIM SHAH*_
'I know you have her. I was on my way northward with some tribesmen when we were ambushed in Shalizah Pass. Many were slain, and the rest of us harried through the hills like jackals. We turned westward toward Amir Jehun Pass, and this morning we came upon a Wazuli wandering through the hills. He was quite mad, but I learned much from his gibberings before he died. I learned he was the sole survivor of a band which followed a chief of the Afghulis and a captive Kshatriya woman into a gorge behind Khurum village. He babbled much of a man in a green turban whom the Afghuli rode down, but who, when attacked by Wazulis, smote them with a nameless doom that wiped them out as wind-driven fire wipes out locusts.'

_*KERIM SHAH*_
'How that one man escaped, I do not know; but I knew from his maunderings that Conan of Ghor had been in Khurum with his captive. Later we overtook a naked Galzai girl bearing water, who told us she had been stripped and ravished by a giant foreigner in Afghuli garb, who gave her garments to a Vendhyan woman. She said you rode westward.'

Kerim Shah did not consider it necessary to explain that he had been on his way to keep a rendezvous with the expected troops from Secunderam when he found his way barred by hostile tribesmen. Barred from the Shalizah road, he had turned to the forbidden route, until news that Conan had not yet reached Afghulistan with his captive caused him to turn southward and push recklessly in the hope of overtaking the Cimmerian.

_*KERIM SHAH*_
'So you had better tell me where the Devi is. We outnumber you—'

_*CONAN*_
'Let one of your dogs nock a shaft and I'll throw you over the cliff. It wouldn't do you any good to kill me. Five hundred Afghulis are on my trail; if they find you’ve cheated them, they'll flay you alive. Anyway, I haven't got the Devi. She's in the hands of the Black Seers of Yimsha.'

_*KERIM SHAH*_
'*Tarim!* Khemsa—'

_*CONAN*_
'Khemsa's dead. His masters sent him to hell on a landslide. And now get out of my way. I'd be glad to kill you if I had the time, but I'm on my way to Yimsha.'

_*KERIM SHAH*_
'I'll go with you.'

_*CONAN*_
'Do you think I'd trust you, you Hyrkanian dog?'

_*KERIM SHAH*_
'I don't ask you to. We both want the Devi. You know my reason; King Yezdigerd desires to add her kingdom to his empire, and herself to his seraglio. And I know *your* ambition—loot. You want to plunder Vendhya and ransom Yasmina. So—let us unite, without illusions, and try to rescue her. If we live, we can fight afterward to see who keeps her.'

Conan scrutinized him, then nodded. 'Agreed. What about your men?'

_*KERIM SHAH*_
'This chief and I are going to Yimsha to fight the wizards. Will you go with us, or stay to be flayed by the Afghulis following him?'

_*IRAKZAI RIDERS*_
'We will go with thee and die on Yimsha.'

_*CONAN*_
'Then in Crom's name let us be gone. My wolves were hours behind me, but we've lost a devilish lot of time.'

Kerim Shah backed his steed from between the stallion and the cliff, sheathing his sword. The band filed up the path as swiftly as they dared. They came out upon the crest nearly a mile east of the spot where Khemsa had halted the Cimmerian and the Devi. The path they had traversed was perilous even for hill-men, which was why Conan had avoided it when carrying Yasmina, though Kerim Shah had taken it, supposing Conan had done likewise. Even Conan sighed with relief when the horses scrambled over the last rim. They moved like phantom riders through an enchanted realm of shadows. The soft creak of leather and the clink of steel marked their passing; then again the dark mountain slopes lay naked and silent in the starlight.
## 8: Yasmina Knows Stark Terror ##

Yasmina had time but for one scream when she felt herself envelo...n of natural sensations gone mad, and then vertigo and oblivion.

A vestige of these sensations clung to her as she recovered cons...stability pervaded her. She took cognizance of her surroundings.

She was lying on a dais covered with black velvet. This dais sto...ment, yet which invaded her mind with a dim and formless terror.

Yasmina felt fear crawl like a trickle of ice-water down her sup...herself on her elbows and stared apprehensively at the stranger.

_*YASMINA*_
Who are you? _(she demanded. Her voice sounded brittle and inadequate.)_

_*FIRST SEER*_
I am the Master of Yimsha. _(The tone was rich and resonant, like the mellow tones of a temple bell.)_

_*YASMINA*_
Why did you bring me here? _(she demanded.)_

_*FIRST SEER*_
Were you not seeking me?

_*YASMINA*_
If you are one of the Black Seers--yes! _(she answered recklessly, believing that he could read her thoughts anyway.)_

He laughed softly, and chills crawled up and down her spine again.

_*FIRST SEER*_
You would turn the wild children of the hills against the Seers...weak, human mind, filled with petty dreams of hate and revenge._

_*YASMINA*_
You slew my brother! _(A rising tide of anger was vying with her...dling in human affairs. Why did you destroy the king of Vendhya?)_

_*YASMINA*_
I understand this: that my brother died! _(Tears of grief and ra...g eyes, as supple and dangerous in that moment as a she-panther.)_

As Yezdigerd desired, _(agreed the Master calmly.)_ For a while it was my whim to further his ambitions.

Is Yezdigerd your vassal? _(Yasmina tried to keep the timbre of ...btly she shifted her position, moving her hand under the fold.)_

_*FIRST SEER*_
Is the dog that licks up the offal in the temple yard the vassal of the god? _(returned the Master.)_

But the Master made no move.

You are a devil, _(she sobbed.)_

_*FIRST SEER*_

_*FIRST SEER*_

He laughed again.

_*FIRST SEER*_
But for all your stupidity, you are a woman fair to look upon. It is my whim to keep you for my slave.

The daughter of a thousand proud emperors gasped with shame and fury at the word.

_*YASMINA*_
You dare not!

His mocking laughter cut her like a whip across her naked shoulders.

_*FIRST SEER*_
The king dares not trample a worm in the road? Little fool, do y...es of the queens of Hell! You have seen how I deal with a rebel!

Cowed and awed, the girl crouched on the velvet-covered dais. Th...aster became shadowy. His voice took on a newer tone of command.

## 9: The Castle of the Wizards ##

The sun had risen over the white Himelian peaks. At the foot of a long slope a group of horsemen halted and stared upward. High above them a stone tower poised on the pitch of the mountainside. Beyond and above that gleamed the walls of a greater keep, near the line where the snow began that capped Yimsha's pinnacle. There was a touch of unreality about the whole--purple slopes pitching up to that fantastic castle, toy-like with distance, and above it the white glistening peak shouldering the cold blue.

_*CONAN*_
We'll leave the horses here, _(grunted Conan.)_ That treacherous slope is safer for a man on foot. Besides, they're done.

He swung down from the black stallion which stood with wide-braced legs and drooping head. They had pushed hard throughout the night, gnawing at scraps from saddle-bags, and pausing only to give the horses the rests they had to have.

_*CONAN*_
That first tower is held by the acolytes of the Black Seers, _(said Conan.)_ Or so men say; watch-dogs for their masters--lesser sorcerers. They won't sit sucking their thumbs as we climb this slope.

Kerim Shah glanced up the mountain, then back the way they had come; they were already far up Yimsha's side, and a vast expanse of lesser peaks and crags spread out beneath them. Among these labyrinths the Turanian sought in vain for a movement of color that would betray men. Evidently the pursuing Afghulis had lost their chief's trail in the night.

_*KERIM SHAH*_
Let us go, then.

They tied the weary horses in a clump of tamarisk and without further comment turned up the slope. There was no cover. It was a naked incline, strewn with boulders not big enough to conceal a man. But they did conceal something else.

The party had not gone fifty steps when a snarling shape burst from behind a rock. It was one of the gaunt savage dogs that infested the hill villages, and its eyes glared redly, its jaws dripped foam. Conan was leading, but it did not attack him. It dashed past him and leaped at Kerim Shah. The Turanian leaped aside, and the great dog flung itself upon the Irakzai behind him. The man yelled and threw up his arm, which was torn by the brute's fangs as it bore him backward, and the next instant half a dozen tulwars were hacking at the beast. Yet not until it was literally dismembered did the hideous creature cease its efforts to seize and rend its attackers.

Kerim Shah bound up the wounded warrior's gashed arm, looked at him narrowly, and then turned away without a word. He rejoined Conan, and they renewed the climb in silence.

Presently Kerim Shah said: *Strange to find a village dog in this place.*

_*CONAN*_
There's no offal here, _(grunted Conan.)_

Both turned their heads to glance back at the wounded warrior toiling after them among his companions. Sweat glistened on his dark face and his lips were drawn back from his teeth in a grimace of pain. Then both looked again at the stone tower squatting above them.

A slumberous quiet lay over the uplands. The tower showed no sign of life, nor did the strange pyramidal structure beyond it. But the men who toiled upward went with the tenseness of men walking on the edge of a crater. Kerim Shah had unslung the powerful Turanian bow that killed at five hundred paces, and the Irakzai looked to their own lighter and less lethal bows.

But they were not within bow-shot of the tower when something shot down out of the sky without warning. It passed so close to Conan that he felt the wind of rushing wings, but it was an Irakzai who staggered and fell, blood jetting from a severed jugular. A hawk with wings like burnished steel shot up again, blood dripping from the scimitar-beak, to reel against the sky as Kerim Shah's bowstring twanged. It dropped like a plummet, but no man saw where it struck the earth.

Conan bent over the victim of the attack, but the man was already dead. No one spoke; useless to comment on the fact that never before had a hawk been known to swoop on a man. Red rage began to vie with fatalistic lethargy in the wild souls of the Irakzai. Hairy fingers nocked arrows and men glared vengefully at the tower whose very silence mocked them.

But the next attack came swiftly. They all saw it--a white puffball of smoke that tumbled over the tower-rim and came drifting and rolling down the slope toward them. Others followed it. They seemed harmless, mere woolly globes of cloudy foam, but Conan stepped aside to avoid contact with the first. Behind him one of the Irakzai reached out and thrust his sword into the unstable mass. Instantly a sharp report shook the mountainside. There was a burst of blinding flame, and then the puffball had vanished, and the too-curious warrior remained only a heap of charred and blackened bones. The crisped hand still gripped the ivory sword-hilt, but the blade was gone--melted and destroyed by that awful heat. Yet men standing almost within reach of the victim had not suffered except to be dazzled and half blinded by the sudden flare.

_*CONAN*_
Steel touches it off, _(grunted Conan.)_ Look out--here they come!

The slope above them was almost covered by the billowing spheres. Kerim Shah bent his bow and sent a shaft into the mass, and those touched by the arrow burst like bubbles in spurting flame. His men followed his example and for the next few minutes it was as if a thunderstorm raged on the mountain slope, with bolts of lightning striking and bursting in showers of flame. When the barrage ceased, only a few arrows were left in the quivers of the archers.

They pushed on grimly, over soil charred and blackened, where the naked rock had in places been turned to lava by the explosion of those diabolical bombs.

Now they were almost within arrow-flight of the silent tower, and they spread their line, nerves taut, ready for any horror that might descend upon them.

On the tower appeared a single figure, lifting a ten-foot bronze horn. Its strident bellow roared out across the echoing slopes, like the blare of trumpets on Judgment Day. And it began to be fearfully answered. The ground trembled under the feet of the invaders, and rumblings and grindings welled up from the subterranean depths.

The Irakzai screamed, reeling like drunken men on the shuddering slope, and Conan, eyes glaring, charged recklessly up the incline, knife in hand, straight at the door that showed in the tower-wall. Above him the great horn roared and bellowed in brutish mockery. And then Kerim Shah drew a shaft to his ear and loosed.

Only a Turanian could have made that shot. The bellowing of the horn ceased suddenly, and a high, thin scream shrilled in its place. The green-robed figure on the tower staggered, clutching at the long shaft which quivered in its bosom, and then pitched across the parapet. The great horn tumbled upon the battlement and hung precariously, and another robed figure rushed to seize it, shrieking in horror. Again the Turanian bow twanged, and again it was answered by a death-howl. The second acolyte, in falling, struck the horn with his elbow and knocked it clattering over the parapet to shatter on the rocks far below.

At such headlong speed had Conan covered the ground that before the clattering echoes of that fall had died away, he was hacking at the door. Warned by his savage instinct, he gave back suddenly as a tide of molten lead splashed down from above. But the next instant he was back again, attacking the panels with redoubled fury. He was galvanized by the fact that his enemies had resorted to earthly weapons. The sorcery of the acolytes was limited. Their necromantic resources might well be exhausted.

Kerim Shah was hurrying up the slope, his hill-men behind him in a straggling crescent. They loosed as they ran, their arrows splintering against the walls or arching over the parapet.

The heavy teak portal gave way beneath the Cimmerian's assault, and he peered inside warily, expecting anything. He was looking into a circular chamber from which a stair wound upward. On the opposite side of the chamber a door gaped open, revealing the outer slope—and the backs of half a dozen green-robed figures in full retreat.

Conan yelled, took a step into the tower, and then native caution jerked him back, just as a great block of stone fell crashing to the floor where his foot had been an instant before. He raced around the tower.

The acolytes had evacuated their first line of defence. As Conan rounded the tower he saw their green robes twinkling up the mountain ahead of him. He gave chase, panting with earnest blood-lust, and behind him Kerim Shah and the Irakzai came pelting, the latter yelling like wolves at the flight of their enemies, their fatalism momentarily submerged by temporary triumph.

The tower stood on the lower edge of a narrow plateau whose upward slant was barely perceptible. A few hundred yards away this plateau ended abruptly in a chasm which had been invisible farther down the mountain. Into this chasm the acolytes apparently leaped without checking their speed. Their pursuers saw the green robes flutter and disappear over the edge.

A few moments later they themselves were standing on the brink of the mighty moat that cut them off from the castle of the Black Seers. It was a sheer-walled ravine that extended in either direction as far as they could see, apparently girdling the mountain, some four hundred yards in width and five hundred feet deep. And in it, from rim to rim, a strange, translucent mist sparkled and shimmered.

Looking down, Conan grunted. Far below him, moving across the glimmering floor, which shone like burnished silver, he saw the forms of the green-robed acolytes. Their outline was wavering and indistinct, like figures seen under deep water. They walked in single file, moving toward the opposite wall.

Kerim Shah nocked an arrow and sent it singing downward. But when it struck the mist that filled the chasm it seemed to lose momentum and direction, wandering widely from its course.

_*CONAN*_
If they went down, so can we! _(he grunted, while Kerim Shah stared after his shaft in amazement.)_ I saw them last at this spot— Squinting down he saw something shining like a golden thread across the canyon floor far below. The acolytes seemed to be following this thread, and there suddenly came to him Khemsa's cryptic words—‘Follow the golden vein!’ On the brink, under his very hand as he crouched, he found it, a thin vein of sparkling gold running from an outcropping of ore to the edge and down across the silvery floor. And he found something else, which had before been invisible to him because of the peculiar refraction of the light. The gold vein followed a narrow ramp which slanted down into the ravine, fitted with niches for hand and foot hold.

_*CONAN*_
Here’s where they went down. _(he grunted to Kerim Shah.)_ They’re no adepts, to waft themselves through the air! We’ll follow them—

It was at that instant that the man who had been bitten by the mad dog cried out horribly and leaped at Kerim Shah, foaming and gnashing his teeth. The Turanian, quick as a cat on his feet, sprang aside and the madman pitched head-first over the brink. The others rushed to the edge and glared after him in amazement. The maniac did not fall plummet-like. He floated slowly down through the rosy haze like a man sinking in deep water. His limbs moved like a man trying to swim, and his features were purple and convulsed beyond the contortions of his madness. Far down at last on the shining floor his body settled and lay still.

_*KERIM SHAH*_
There’s death in that chasm. _(he muttered, drawing back from the rosy mist that shimmered almost at his feet.)_ What now, Conan?

_*CONAN*_
On! _(answered the Cimmerian grimly.)_ Those acolytes are human; if the mist doesn’t kill them, it won’t kill me.

He hitched his belt, and his hands touched the girdle Khemsa had given him; he scowled, then smiled bleakly. He had forgotten that girdle; yet thrice had death passed him by to strike another victim.

The acolytes had reached the farther wall and were moving up it like great green flies. Letting himself upon the ramp, he descended warily. The rosy cloud lapped about his ankles, ascending as he lowered himself. It reached his knees, his thighs, his waist, his armpits. He felt as one feels a thick heavy fog on a damp night. With it lapping about his chin he hesitated, and then ducked under. Instantly his breath ceased; all air was shut off from him and he felt his ribs caving in on his vitals. With a frantic effort he heaved himself up, fighting for life. His head rose above the surface and he drank air in great gulps.

Kerim Shah leaned down toward him, spoke to him, but Conan neither heard nor heeded. Stubbornly, his mind fixed on what the dying Khemsa had told him, the Cimmerian groped for the gold vein, and found that he had moved off it in his descent. Several series of hand-holds were niched in the ramp. Placing himself directly over the thread, he began climbing down once more. The rosy mist rose about him, engulfed him. Now his head was under, but he was still drinking pure air. Above him he saw his companions staring down at him, their features blurred by the haze that shimmered over his head. He gestured for them to follow, and went down swiftly, without waiting to see whether they complied or not.

Kerim Shah sheathed his sword without comment and followed, and the Irakzai, more fearful of being left alone than of the terrors that might lurk below, scrambled after him. Each man clung to the golden thread as they saw the Cimmerian do.

Down the slanting ramp they went to the ravine floor and moved out across the shining level, treading the gold vein like rope-walkers. It was as if they walked along an invisible tunnel through which air circulated freely. They felt death pressing in on them above and on either hand, but it did not touch them.

The vein crawled up a similar ramp on the other wall up which the acolytes had disappeared, and up it they went with taut nerves, not knowing what might be waiting for them among the jutting spurs of rock that fanged the lip of the precipice.

It was the green-robed acolytes who awaited them, with knives in their hands. Perhaps they had reached the limits to which they could retreat. Perhaps the Stygian girdle about Conan’s waist could have told why their necromantic spells had proven so weak and so quickly exhausted. Perhaps it was knowledge of death decreed for failure that sent them leaping from among the rocks, eyes glaring and knives glittering, resorting in their desperation to material weapons.

There among the rocky fangs on the precipice lip was no war of wizard craft. It was a whirl of blades, where real steel bit and real blood spurted, where sinewy arms dealt forthright blows that severed quivering flesh, and men went down to be trodden under foot as the fight raged over them.

One of the Irakzai bled to death among the rocks, but the acolytes were down—slashed and hacked asunder or hurled over the edge to float sluggishly down to the silver floor that shone so far below.

Then the conquerors shook blood and sweat from their eyes, and looked at one another. Conan and Kerim Shah still stood upright, and four of the Irakzai.

They stood among the rocky teeth that serrated the precipice brink, and from that spot a path wound up a gentle slope to a broad stair, consisting of half a dozen steps, a hundred feet across, cut out of a green jade-like substance. They led up to a broad stage or roofless gallery of the same polished stone, and above it rose, tier upon tier, the castle of the Black Seers. It seemed to have been carved out of the sheer stone of the mountain. The architecture was faultless, but unadorned. The many casements were barred and masked with curtains within. There was no sign of life, friendly or hostile.

They went up the path in silence, and warily as men treading the lair of a serpent. The Irakzai were dumb, like men marching to a certain doom. Even Kerim Shah was silent. Only Conan seemed unaware what a monstrous dislocating and uprooting of accepted thought and action their invasion constituted, what an unprecedented violation of tradition. He was not of the East; and he came of a breed who fought devils and wizards as promptly and matter-of-factly as they battled human foes.

He strode up the shining stairs and across the wide green gallery straight toward the great golden-bound teak door that opened upon it. He cast but a single glance upward at the higher tiers of the great pyramidal structure towering above him. He reached a hand for the bronze prong that jutted like a handle from the door--then checked himself, grinning hardly. The handle was made in the shape of a serpent, head lifted on arched neck; and Conan had a suspicion that that metal head would come to grisly life under his hand.

He struck it from the door with one blow, and its bronze clink on the glassy floor did not lessen his caution. He flipped it aside with his knife-point, and again turned to the door. Utter silence reigned over the towers. Far below them the mountain slopes fell away into a purple haze of distance. The sun glittered on snow-clad peaks on either hand. High above, a vulture hung like a black dot in the cold blue of the sky. But for it, the men before the gold-bound door were the only evidence of life, tiny figures on a green jade gallery poised on the dizzy height, with that fantastic pile of stone towering above them.

A sharp wind off the snow slashed them, whipping their tatters about. Conan's long knife splintering through the teak panels roused the startled echoes. Again and again he struck, hewing through polished wood and metal bands alike. Through the sundered ruins he glared into the interior, alert and suspicious as a wolf. He saw a broad chamber, the polished stone walls untapestried, the mosaic floor uncarpeted. Square, polished ebon stools and a stone dais formed the only furnishings. The room was empty of human life. Another door showed in the opposite wall.

_*CONAN*_
Leave a man on guard outside, _(grunted Conan.)_ I'm going in.

Kerim Shah designated a warrior for that duty, and the man fell back toward the middle of the gallery, bow in hand. Conan strode into the castle, followed by the Turanian and the three remaining Irakzai. The one outside spat, grumbled in his beard, and started suddenly as a low mocking laugh reached his ears.

He lifted his head and saw, on the tier above him, a tall, black-robed figure, naked head nodding slightly as he stared down. His whole attitude suggested mockery and malignity. Quick as a flash the Irakzai bent his bow and loosed, and the arrow streaked upward to strike full in the black-robed breast. The mocking smile did not alter. The Seer plucked out the missile and threw it back at the bowman, not as a weapon is hurled, but with a contemptuous gesture. The Irakzai dodged, instinctively throwing up his arm. His fingers closed on the revolving shaft.

Then he shrieked. In his hand the wooden shaft suddenly *writhed*. Its rigid outline became pliant, melting in his grasp. He tried to throw it from him, but it was too late. He held a living serpent in his naked hand, and already it had coiled about his wrist and its wicked wedge-shaped head darted at his muscular arm. He screamed again and his eyes became distended, his features purple. He went to his knees shaken by an awful convulsion, and then lay still.

The men inside had wheeled at his first cry. Conan took a swift stride toward the open doorway, and then halted short, baffled. To the men behind him it seemed that he strained against empty air. But though he could see nothing, there was a slick, smooth, hard surface under his hands, and he knew that a sheet of crystal had been let down in the doorway. Through it he saw the Irakzai lying motionless on the glassy gallery, an ordinary arrow sticking in his arm.

Conan lifted his knife and smote, and the watchers were dumbfounded to see his blow checked apparently in midair, with the loud clang of steel that meets an unyielding substance. He wasted no more effort. He knew that not even the legendary tulwar of Amir Khurum could shatter that invisible curtain.

In a few words he explained the matter to Kerim Shah, and the Turanian shrugged his shoulders.

_*KERIM SHAH*_
Well, if our exit is barred, we must find another. _(said he.)_ In the meanwhile our way lies forward, does it not?

With a grunt the Cimmerian turned and strode across the chamber to the opposite door, with a feeling of treading on the threshold of doom. As he lifted his knife to shatter the door, it swung silently open as if of its own accord. He strode into the great hall, flanked with tall glassy columns. A hundred feet from the door began the broad jade-green steps of a stair that tapered toward the top like the side of a pyramid. What lay beyond that stair he could not tell. But between him and its shimmering foot stood a curious altar of gleaming black jade. Four great golden serpents twined their tails about this altar and reared their wedge-shaped heads in the air, facing the four quarters of the compass like the enchanted guardians of a fabled treasure. But on the altar, between the arching necks, stood only a crystal globe filled with a cloudy smoke-like substance, in which floated four golden pomegranates.

The sight stirred some dim recollection in his mind; then Conan heeded the altar no longer, for on the lower steps of the stair stood four black-robed figures. He had not seen them come. They were simply there, tall, gaunt, their vulture-heads nodding in unison, their feet and hands hidden by their flowing garments.

One lifted his arm and the sleeve fell away revealing his hand--and it was not a hand at all. Conan halted in mid-stride, compelled against his will. He had encountered a force differing subtly from Khemsa's mesmerism, and he could not advance, though he felt it in his power to retreat if he wished. His companions had likewise halted, and they seemed even more helpless than he, unable to move in either direction.

The seer whose arm was lifted beckoned to one of the Irakzai, and the man moved toward him like one in a trance, eyes staring and fixed, blade hanging in limp fingers. As he pushed past Conan, the Cimmerian threw an arm across his breast to arrest him. Conan was so much stronger than the Irakzai that in ordinary circumstances he could have broken his spine between his hands. But now the muscular arm was brushed aside like straw and the Irakzai moved toward the stair, treading jerkily and mechanically. He reached the steps and knelt stiffly, proffering his blade and bending his head. The Seer took the sword. It flashed as he swung it up and down. The Irakzai's head tumbled from his shoulders and thudded heavily on the black marble floor. An arch of blood jetted from the severed arteries and the body slumped over and lay with arms spread wide.

Again a malformed hand lifted and beckoned, and another Irakzai stumbled stiffly to his doom. The ghastly drama was re-enacted and another headless form lay beside the first.

As the third tribesman clumped his way past Conan to his death, the Cimmerian, his veins bulging in his temples with his efforts to break past the unseen barrier that held him, was suddenly aware of allied forces, unseen, but waking into life about him. This realization came without warning, but so powerfully that he could not doubt his instinct. His left hand slid involuntarily under his Bakhariot belt and closed on the Stygian girdle. And as he gripped it he felt new strength flood his numbed limbs; the will to live was a pulsing white-hot fire, matched by the intensity of his burning rage.

The third Irakzai was a decapitated corpse, and the hideous finger was lifting again when Conan felt the bursting of the invisible barrier. A fierce, involuntary cry burst from his lips as he leaped with the explosive suddenness of pent-up ferocity. His left hand gripped the sorcerer's girdle as a drowning man grips a floating log, and the long knife was a sheen of light in his right. The men on the steps did not move. They watched calmly, cynically; if they felt surprise they did not show it. Conan did not allow himself to think what might chance when he came within knife-reach of them. His blood was pounding in his temples, a mist of crimson swam before his sight. He was afire with the urge to kill--to drive his knife deep into flesh and bone, and twist the blade in blood and entrails.

Another dozen strides would carry him to the steps where the sneering demons stood. He drew his breath deep, his fury rising redly as his charge gathered momentum. He was hurtling past the altar with its golden serpents when like a levin-flash there shot across his mind again as vividly as if spoken in his external ear, the cryptic words of Khemsa: *Break the crystal ball!*

His reaction was almost without his own volition. Execution followed impulse so spontaneously that the greatest sorcerer of the age would not have had time to read his mind and prevent his action. Wheeling like a cat from his headlong charge, he brought his knife crashing down upon the crystal. Instantly the air vibrated with a peal of terror, whether from the stairs, the altar, or the crystal itself he could not tell. Hisses filled his ears as the golden serpents, suddenly vibrant with hideous life, writhed and smote at him. But he was fired to the speed of a maddened tiger. A whirl of steel sheared through the hideous trunks that waved toward him, and he smote the crystal sphere again and yet again. And the globe burst with a noise like a thunderclap, raining fiery shards on the black marble, and the gold pomegranates, as if released from captivity, shot upward toward the lofty roof and were gone.

A mad screaming, bestial and ghastly, was echoing through the great hall. On the steps writhed four black-robed figures, twisting in convulsions, froth dripping from their livid mouths. Then with one frenzied crescendo of inhuman ululation they stiffened and lay still, and Conan knew that they were dead. He stared down at the altar and the crystal shards. Four headless golden serpents still coiled about the altar, but no alien life now animated the dully gleaming metal.

Kerim Shah was rising slowly from his knees, whither he had been dashed by some unseen force. He shook his head to clear the ringing from his ears.

_*KERIM SHAH*_
Did you hear that crash when you struck? _(he said.)_ It was as if a thousand crystal panels shattered all over the castle as that globe burst. Were the souls of the wizards imprisoned in those golden balls?--Ha!

Conan wheeled as Kerim Shah drew his sword and pointed.

Another figure stood at the head of the stair. His robe, too, was black, but of richly embroidered velvet, and there was a velvet cap on his head. His face was calm, and not unhandsome.

_*CONAN*_
Who the devil are you? _(demanded Conan, staring up at him, knife in hand.)_

_*FIRST SEER*_
I am the Master of Yimsha! _(His voice was like the chime of a temple bell, but a note of cruel mirth ran through it.)_

_*KERIM SHAH*_
Where is Yasmina? _(demanded Kerim Shah.)_

The Master laughed down at him.

_*FIRST SEER*_
What is that to you, dead man? Have you so quickly forgotten my strength, once lent to you, that you come armed against me, you poor fool? I think I will take your heart, Kerim Shah!

He held out his hand as if to receive something, and the Turanian cried out sharply like a man in mortal agony. He reeled drunkenly, and then, with a splintering of bones, a rending of flesh and muscle and a snapping of mail-links, his breast burst outward with a shower of blood, and through the ghastly aperture something red and dripping shot through the air into the Master's outstretched hand, as a bit of steel leaps to the magnet. The Turanian slumped to the floor and lay motionless, and the Master laughed and hurled the object to fall before Conan's feet--a still-quivering human heart.

With a roar and a curse Conan charged the stair. From Khemsa's girdle he felt strength and deathless hate flow into him to combat the terrible emanation of power that met him on the steps. The air filled with a shimmering steely haze through which he plunged like a swimmer, head lowered, left arm bent about his face, knife gripped low in his right hand. His half-blinded eyes, glaring over the crook of his elbow, made out the hated shape of the Seer before and above him, the outline wavering as a reflection wavers in disturbed water.

He was racked and torn by forces beyond his comprehension, but he felt a driving power outside and beyond his own lifting him inexorably upward and onward, despite the wizard's strength and his own agony.

Now he had reached the head of the stairs, and the Master's face floated in the steely haze before him, and a strange fear shadowed the inscrutable eyes. Conan waded through the mist as through a surf, and his knife lunged upward like a live thing. The keen point ripped the Master's robe as he sprang back with a low cry. Then before Conan's gaze, the wizard vanished--simply disappeared like a burst bubble, and something long and undulating darted up one of the smaller stairs that led up to left and right from the landing.

Conan charged after it, up the left-hand stair, uncertain as to just what he had seen whip up those steps, but in a berserk mood that drowned the nausea and horror whispering at the back of his consciousness.

He plunged out into a broad corridor whose uncarpeted floor and untapestried walls were of polished jade, and something long and swift whisked down the corridor ahead of him, and into a curtained door. From within the chamber rose a scream of urgent terror. The sound lent wings to Conan's flying feet and he hurtled through the curtains and headlong into the chamber within.

A frightful scene met his glare. Yasmina cowered on the farther edge of a velvet-covered dais, screaming her loathing and horror, an arm lifted as if to ward off attack, while before her swayed the hideous head of a giant serpent, shining neck arching up from dark-gleaming coils. With a choked cry Conan threw his knife.

Instantly the monster whirled and was upon him like the rush of wind through tall grass. The long knife quivered in its neck, point and a foot of blade showing on one side, and the hilt and a hand's-breadth of steel on the other, but it only seemed to madden the giant reptile. The great head towered above the man who faced it, and then darted down, the venom-dripping jaws gaping wide. But Conan had plucked a dagger from his girdle and he stabbed upward as the head dipped down. The point tore through the lower jaw and transfixed the upper, pinning them together. The next instant the great trunk had looped itself about the Cimmerian as the snake, unable to use its fangs, employed its remaining form of attack.

Conan's left arm was pinioned among the bone-crushing folds, but his right was free. Bracing his feet to keep upright, he stretched forth his hand, gripped the hilt of the long knife jutting from the serpent's neck, and tore it free in a shower of blood. As if divining his purpose with more than bestial intelligence, the snake writhed and knotted, seeking to cast its loops about his right arm. But with the speed of light the long knife rose and fell, shearing halfway through the reptile's giant trunk.

Before he could strike again, the great pliant loops fell from him and the monster dragged itself across the floor, gushing blood from its ghastly wounds. Conan sprang after it, knife lifted, but his vicious swipe cut empty air as the serpent writhed away from him and struck its blunt nose against a paneled screen of sandalwood. One of the panels gave inward and the long, bleeding barrel whipped through it and was gone.

Conan instantly attacked the screen. A few blows rent it apart and he glared into the dim alcove beyond. No horrific shape coiled there; there was blood on the marble floor, and bloody tracks led to a cryptic arched door. Those tracks were of a man's bare feet....

_*YASMINA*_
Conan! _(She rushed across the room and threw herself upon him, catching him about the neck with a frantic clasp, half hysterical with terror and gratitude and relief.)_

His wild blood had been stirred to its uttermost by all that had passed. He caught her to him in a grasp that would have made her wince at another time, and crushed her lips with his. She made no resistance; the Devi was drowned in the elemental woman. She closed her eyes and drank in his fierce, hot, lawless kisses with all the abandon of passionate thirst. She was panting with his violence when he ceased for breath, and glared down at her lying limp in his mighty arms.

_*YASMINA*_
I knew you'd come for me, _(she murmured.)_ You would not leave me in this den of devils.

At her words recollection of their environment came to him suddenly. He lifted his head and listened intently. Silence reigned over the castle of Yimsha, but it was a silence impregnated with menace. Peril crouched in every corner, leered invisibly from every hanging.

_*CONAN*_
We'd better go while we can, _(he muttered.)_ Those cuts were enough to kill any common beast--or *man*--but a wizard has a dozen lives. Wound one, and he writhes away like a crippled snake to soak up fresh venom from some source of sorcery.

He picked up the girl and carrying her in his arms like a child, he strode out into the gleaming jade corridor and down the stairs, nerves tautly alert for any sign or sound.

_*YASMINA*_
I met the Master, _(she whispered, clinging to him and shuddering.)_ He worked his spells on me to break my will. The most awful thing was a moldering corpse which seized me in its arms--I fainted then and lay as one dead, I do not know how long. Shortly after I regained consciousness I heard sounds of strife below, and cries, and then that snake came slithering through the curtains--ah! I knew somehow that it was not an illusion, but a real serpent that sought my life.

_*CONAN*_
It was not a shadow, at least, _(answered Conan cryptically.)_ He knew he was beaten, and chose to slay you rather than let you be rescued.

_*YASMINA*_
What do you mean, *he*? _(she asked uneasily,)_ and then shrank against him, crying out, and forgetting her question. She had seen the corpses at the foot of the stairs. Those of the Seers were not good to look at; as they lay twisted and contorted, their hands and feet were exposed to view, and at the sight Yasmina went livid and hid her face against Conan's powerful shoulder.
## 10 Yasmina and Conan

Conan passed through the hall quickly enough, traversed the outer chamber and approached the door that led upon the gallery. Then he saw the floor sprinkled with tiny, glittering shards. The crystal sheet that had covered the doorway had been shivered to bits, and he remembered the crash that had accompanied the shattering of the crystal globe. He believed that every piece of crystal in the castle had broken at that instant, and some dim instinct or memory of esoteric lore vaguely suggested the truth of the monstrous connection between the Lords of the Black Circle and the golden pomegranates. He felt the short hair bristle chilly at the back of his neck and put the matter hastily out of his mind.

He breathed a deep sigh of relief as he stepped out upon the green jade gallery. There was still the gorge to cross, but at least he could see the white peaks glistening in the sun, and the long slopes falling away into the distant blue hazes.

The Irakzai lay where he had fallen, an ugly blotch on the glassy smoothness. As Conan strode down the winding path, he was surprised to note the position of the sun. It had not yet passed its zenith; and yet it seemed to him that hours had passed since he plunged into the castle of the Black Seers.

He felt an urge to hasten, not a mere blind panic, but an instinct of peril growing behind his back. He said nothing to Yasmina, and she seemed content to nestle her dark head against his arching breast and find security in the clasp of his iron arms. He paused an instant on the brink of the chasm, frowning down. The haze which danced in the gorge was no longer rose-hued and sparkling. It was smoky, dim, ghostly, like the life-tide that flickered thinly in a wounded man. The thought came vaguely to Conan that the spells of magicians were more closely bound to their personal beings than were the actions of common men to the actors.

But far below, the floor shone like tarnished silver, and the gold thread sparkled undimmed. Conan shifted Yasmina across his shoulder, where she lay docilely, and began the descent. Hurriedly he descended the ramp, and hurriedly he fled across the echoing floor. He had a conviction that they were racing with time, that their chances of survival depended upon crossing that gorge of horrors before the wounded Master of the castle should regain enough power to loose some other doom upon them.

When he toiled up the farther ramp and came out upon the crest, he breathed a gusty sigh of relief and stood Yasmina upon her feet.

_*CONAN*_
You walk from here, _(he told her;)_ it's downhill all the way.

She stole a glance at the gleaming pyramid across the chasm; it reared up against the snowy slope like the citadel of silence and immemorial evil.

_*YASMINA*_
Are you a magician, that you have conquered the Black Seers of Yimsha, Conan of Ghor? _(she asked, as they went down the path, with his heavy arm about her supple waist.)_

_*CONAN*_
It was a girdle Khemsa gave me before he died, _(Conan answered.)_ Yes, I found him on the trail. It is a curious one, which I'll show you when I have time. Against some spells it was weak, but against others it was strong, and a good knife is always a hearty incantation.

_*YASMINA*_
But if the girdle aided you in conquering the Master, _(she argued,)_ why did it not aid Khemsa?

He shook his head.

_*CONAN*_
Who knows? But Khemsa had been the Master's slave; perhaps that weakened its magic. He had no hold on me as he had on Khemsa. Yet I can't say that I conquered him. He retreated, but I have a feeling that we haven't seen the last of him. I want to put as many miles between us and his lair as we can.

He was further relieved to find horses tethered among the tamarisks as he had left them. He loosed them swiftly and mounted the black stallion, swinging the girl up before him. The others followed, freshened by their rest.

_*YASMINA*_
And what now? _(she asked.)_ To Afghulistan?

_*CONAN*_
Not just now! _(He grinned hardly.)_ Somebody--maybe the governor--killed my seven headmen. My idiotic followers think I had something to do with it, and unless I am able to convince them otherwise, they'll hunt me like a wounded jackal.

_*YASMINA*_
Then what of me? If the headmen are dead, I am useless to you as a hostage. Will you slay me, to avenge them?

He looked down at her, with eyes fiercely aglow, and laughed at the suggestion.

_*YASMINA*_
Then let us ride to the border, _(she said.)_ You'll be safe from the Afghulis there--

_*CONAN*_
Yes, on a Vendhyan gibbet.

_*YASMINA*_
I am Queen of Vendhya, _(she reminded him with a touch of her old imperiousness.)_ You have saved my life. You shall be rewarded.

She did not intend it as it sounded, but he growled in his throat, ill pleased.

_*CONAN*_
Keep your bounty for your city-bred dogs, princess! If you're a queen of the plains, I'm a chief of the hills, and not one foot toward the border will I take you!

_*YASMINA*_
But you would be safe-- _(she began bewilderedly.)_

_*CONAN*_
And you'd be the Devi again, _(he broke in.)_ No, girl; I prefer you as you are now--a woman of flesh and blood, riding on my saddle-bow.

_*YASMINA*_
But you can't *keep* me! _(she cried.)_ You can't--

_*CONAN*_
Watch and see! _(he advised grimly.)_

_*YASMINA*_
But I will pay you a vast ransom--

_*CONAN*_
Devil take your ransom! _(he answered roughly, his arms hardening about her supple figure.)_ The kingdom of Vendhya could give me nothing I desire half so much as I desire you. I took you at the risk of my neck; if your courtiers want you back, let them come up the Zhaibar and fight for you.

_*YASMINA*_
But you have no followers now! _(she protested.)_ You are hunted! How can you preserve your own life, much less mine?

_*CONAN*_
I still have friends in the hills, _(he answered.)_ There is a chief of the Khurakzai who will keep you safely while I bicker with the Afghulis. If they will have none of me, by Crom! I will ride northward with you to the steppes of the *kozaki*. I was a hetman among the Free Companions before I rode southward. I'll make you a queen on the Zaporoska River!

_*YASMINA*_
But I can not! _(she objected.)_ You must not hold me--

_*CONAN*_
If the idea's so repulsive, _(he demanded,)_ why did you yield your lips to me so willingly?

_*YASMINA*_
Even a queen is human, _(she answered, coloring.)_ But because I am a queen, I must consider my kingdom. Do not carry me away into some foreign country. Come back to Vendhya with me!

_*CONAN*_
Would you make me your king? _(he asked sardonically.)_

_*YASMINA*_
Well, there are customs-- _(she stammered, and he interrupted her with a hard laugh.)_

_*CONAN*_
Yes, civilized customs that won't let you do as you wish. You'll marry some withered old king of the plains, and I can go my way with only the memory of a few kisses snatched from your lips. Ha!

_*YASMINA*_
But I must return to my kingdom! _(she repeated helplessly.)_

_*CONAN*_
Why? _(he demanded angrily.)_ To chafe your rump on gold thrones, and listen to the plaudits of smirking, velvet-skirted fools? Where is the gain? Listen: I was born in the Cimmerian hills where the people are all barbarians. I have been a mercenary soldier, a corsair, a *kozak*, and a hundred other things. What king has roamed the countries, fought the battles, loved the women, and won the plunder that I have?

_*CONAN*_
I came into Ghulistan to raise a horde and plunder the kingdoms to the south--your own among them. Being chief of the Afghulis was only a start. If I can conciliate them, I'll have a dozen tribes following me within a year. But if I can't I'll ride back to the steppes and loot the Turanian borders with the *kozaki*. And you'll go with me. To the devil with your kingdom; they fended for themselves before you were born.

She lay in his arms looking up at him, and she felt a tug at her spirit, a lawless, reckless urge that matched his own and was by it called into being. But a thousand generations of sovereignship rode heavy upon her.

_*YASMINA*_
I can't! I can't! _(she repeated helplessly.)_

_*CONAN*_
You haven't any choice, _(he assured her.)_ You--what the devil!

They had left Yimsha some miles behind them, and were riding along a high ridge that separated two deep valleys. They had just topped a steep crest where they could gaze down into the valley on their right hand. And there was a running fight in progress. A strong wind was blowing away from them, carrying the sound from their ears, but even so the clashing of steel and thunder of hoofs welled up from far below.

They saw the glint of the sun on lance-tip and spired helmet. Three thousand mailed horsemen were driving before them a ragged band of turbaned riders, who fled snarling and striking like fleeing wolves.

_*CONAN*_
Turanians, _(muttered Conan.)_ Squadrons from Secunderam. What the devil are they doing here?

_*YASMINA*_
Who are the men they pursue? _(asked Yasmina.)_ And why do they fall back so stubbornly? They can not stand against such odds.

_*CONAN*_
Five hundred of my mad Afghulis, _(he growled.)_ They're in a trap, and they know it.

The valley was indeed a cul-de-sac at that end. It narrowed to a high-walled gorge, opening out further into a round bowl, completely rimmed with lofty, unscalable walls.

The turbaned riders were being forced into this gorge, because there was nowhere else for them to go, and they went reluctantly, in a shower of arrows and a whirl of swords. The helmeted riders harried them, but did not press in too rashly. They knew the desperate fury of the hill tribes, and they knew too that they had their prey in a trap from which there was no escape. They had recognized the hill-men as Afghulis, and they wished to hem them in and force a surrender. They needed hostages for the purpose they had in mind.

Their emir was a man of decision and initiative. When he reached the Gurashah valley, and found neither guides nor emissary waiting for him, he pushed on, trusting to his own knowledge of the country. All the way from Secunderam there had been fighting, and tribesmen were licking their wounds in many a crag-perched village. He knew there was a good chance that neither he nor any of his helmeted spearmen would ever ride through the gates of Secunderam again, for the tribes would all be up behind him now, but he was determined to carry out his orders--which were to take Yasmina Devi from the Afghulis at all costs, and to bring her captive to Secunderam, or if confronted by impossibility, to strike off her head before he himself died.

Of all this, of course, the watchers on the ridge were not aware. But Conan fidgeted with nervousness.

_*CONAN*_
Why the devil did they get themselves trapped? _(he demanded of the universe at large.)_ I know what they're doing in these parts--they were hunting me, the dogs! Poking into every valley--and found themselves penned in before they knew it. The poor fools! They're making a stand in the gorge, but they can't hold out for long. When the Turanians have pushed them back into the bowl, they'll slaughter them at their leisure.

The din welling up from below increased in volume and intensity. In the strait of the narrow gut, the Afghulis, fighting desperately, were for the time holding their own against the mailed riders, who could not throw their whole weight against them.

Conan scowled darkly, moved restlessly, fingering his hilt, and finally spoke bluntly:

_*CONAN*_
Devi, I must go down to them. I'll find a place for you to hide until I come back to you. You spoke of your kingdom--well, I don't pretend to look on those hairy devils as my children, but after all, such as they are, they're my henchmen. A chief should never desert his followers, even if they desert him first. They think they were right in kicking me out--hell, I won't be cast off! I'm still chief of the Afghulis, and I'll prove it! I can climb down on foot into the gorge.

_*YASMINA*_
But what of me? _(she queried.)_ You carried me away forcibly from *my* people; now will you leave me to die in the hills alone while you go down and sacrifice yourself uselessly?

His veins swelled with the conflict of his emotions.

_*CONAN*_
That's right, _(he muttered helplessly.)_ Crom knows what I _can_ do.

She turned her head slightly, a curious expression dawning on her beautiful face. Then:

_*YASMINA*_
Listen! _(she cried.)_ Listen!

A distant fanfare of trumpets was borne faintly to their ears. They stared into the deep valley on the left, and caught a glint of steel on the farther side. A long line of lances and polished helmets moved along the vale, gleaming in the sunlight.

_*YASMINA*_
The riders of Vendhya! _(she cried exultingly.)_

_*CONAN*_
There are thousands of them! _(muttered Conan.)_ It has been long since a Kshatriya host has ridden this far into the hills.

_*YASMINA*_
They are searching for me! _(she exclaimed.)_ Give me your horse! I will ride to my warriors! The ridge is not so precipitous on the left, and I can reach the valley floor. I will lead my horsemen into the valley at the upper end and fall upon the Turanians! We will crush them in the vise! Quick, Conan! Will you sacrifice your men to your own desire?

The burning hunger of the steppes and the wintry forests glared out of his eyes, but he shook his head and swung off the stallion, placing the reins in her hands.

_*CONAN*_
You win! _(he grunted.)_ Ride like the devil!

She wheeled away down the left-hand slope and he ran swiftly along the ridge until he reached the long ragged cleft that was the defile in which the fight raged. Down the rugged wall he scrambled like an ape, clinging to projections and crevices, to fall at last, feet first, into the mêlée that raged in the mouth of the gorge. Blades were whickering and clanging about him, horses rearing and stamping, helmet plumes nodding among turbans that were stained crimson.

As he hit, he yelled like a wolf, caught a gold-worked rein, and dodging the sweep of a scimitar, drove his long knife upward through the rider's vitals. In another instant he was in the saddle, yelling ferocious orders to the Afghulis. They stared at him stupidly for an instant; then as they saw the havoc his steel was wreaking among their enemies, they fell to their work again, accepting him without comment. In that inferno of licking blades and spurting blood there was no time to ask or answer questions.

The riders in their spired helmets and gold-worked hauberks swarmed about the gorge mouth, thrusting and slashing, and the narrow defile was packed and jammed with horses and men, the warriors crushed breast to breast, stabbing with shortened blades, slashing murderously when there was an instant's room to swing a sword. When a man went down he did not get up from beneath the stamping, swirling hoofs. Weight and sheer strength counted heavily there, and the chief of the Afghulis did the work of ten. At such times accustomed habits sway men strongly, and the warriors, who were used to seeing Conan in their vanguard, were heartened mightily, despite their distrust of him.

But superior numbers counted too. The pressure of the men behind forced the horsemen of Turan deeper and deeper into the gorge, in the teeth of the flickering tulwars. Foot by foot the Afghulis were shoved back, leaving the defile-floor carpeted with dead, on which the riders trampled. As he hacked and smote like a man possessed, Conan had time for some chilling doubts--would Yasmina keep her word? She had but to join her warriors, turn southward and leave him and his band to perish.

But at last, after what seemed centuries of desperate battling, in the valley outside there rose another sound above the clash of steel and yells of slaughter. And then with a burst of trumpets that shook the walls, and rushing thunder of hoofs, five thousand riders of Vendhya smote the hosts of Secunderam.

That stroke split the Turanian squadrons asunder, shattered, tore and rent them and scattered their fragments all over the valley. In an instant the surge had ebbed back out of the gorge; there was a chaotic, confused swirl of fighting, horsemen wheeling and smiting singly and in clusters, and then the emir went down with a Kshatriya lance through his breast, and the riders in their spired helmets turned their horses down the valley, spurring like mad and seeking to slash a way through the swarms which had come upon them from the rear. As they scattered in flight, the conquerors scattered in pursuit, and all across the valley floor, and up on the slopes near the mouth and over the crests streamed the fugitives and the pursuers. The Afghulis, those left to ride, rushed out of the gorge and joined in the harrying of their foes, accepting the unexpected alliance as unquestioningly as they had accepted the return of their repudiated chief.

The sun was sinking toward the distant crags when Conan, his garments hacked to tatters and the mail under them reeking and clotted with blood, his knife dripping and crusted to the hilt, strode over the corpses to where Yasmina Devi sat her horse among her nobles on the crest of the ridge, near a lofty precipice.

_*CONAN*_
You kept your word, Devi! _(he roared.)_ By Crom, though, I had some bad seconds down in that gorge--*look out!*

Down from the sky swooped a vulture of tremendous size with a thunder of wings that knocked men sprawling from their horses.

The scimitar-like beak was slashing for the Devi's soft neck, but Conan was quicker--a short run, a tigerish leap, the savage thrust of a dripping knife, and the vulture voiced a horribly human cry, pitched sideways and went tumbling down the cliffs to the rocks and river a thousand feet below. As it dropped, its black wings thrashing the air, it took on the semblance, not of a bird, but of a black-robed human body that fell, arms in wide black sleeves thrown abroad.

Conan turned to Yasmina, his red knife still in his hand, his blue eyes smoldering, blood oozing from wounds on his thickly muscled arms and thighs.

_*CONAN*_
You are the Devi again, _(he said, grinning fiercely at the gold-clasped gossamer robe she had donned over her hill-girl attire, and awed not at all by the imposing array of chivalry about him.)_ I have you to thank for the lives of some three hundred and fifty of my rogues, who are at least convinced that I didn't betray them. You have put my hands on the reins of conquest again.

_*YASMINA*_
I still owe you my ransom, _(she said, her dark eyes glowing as they swept over him.)_ Ten thousand pieces of gold I will pay you--

_*CONAN*_
I will collect your ransom in my own way, at my own time, _(he said.)_ I will collect it in your palace at Ayodhya, and I will come with fifty thousand men to see that the scales are fair.

_(She laughed, gathering her reins into her hands.)_

_*YASMINA*_
And I will meet you on the shores of the Jhumda with a hundred thousand!

His eyes shone with fierce appreciation and admiration, and stepping back, he lifted his hand with a gesture that was like the assumption of kingship, indicating that her road was clear before her.
