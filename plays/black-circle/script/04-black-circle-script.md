## 4 An Encounter in the Pass ##

Yasmina Devi could never clearly remember the details of her abduction. The unexpectedness and violence stunned her; she had only a confused impression of a whirl of happenings—the terrifying grip of a mighty arm, the blazing eyes of her abductor, and his hot breath burning on her flesh. The leap through the window to the parapet, the mad race across battlements and roofs when the fear of falling froze her, the reckless descent of a rope bound to a merlon—he went down almost at a run, his captive folded limply over his brawny shoulder—all this was a befuddled tangle in the Devi's mind. She retained a more vivid memory of him running fleetly into the shadows of the trees, carrying her like a child, and vaulting into the saddle of a fierce Bhalkhana stallion which reared and snorted. Then there was a sensation of flying, and the racing hoofs were striking sparks of fire from the flinty road as the stallion swept up the slopes.

As the girl's mind cleared, her first sensations were furious rage and shame. She was appalled. The rulers of the golden kingdoms south of the Himelians were considered little short of divine; and she was the Devi of Vendhya! Fright was submerged in regal wrath. She cried out furiously and began struggling. She, Yasmina, to be carried on the saddle-bow of a hill chief, like a common wench of the market-place! He merely hardened his massive thews slightly against her writhings, and for the first time in her life she experienced the coercion of superior physical strength. His arms felt like iron about her slender limbs. He glanced down at her and grinned hugely. His teeth glimmered whitely in the starlight. The reins lay loose on the stallion's flowing mane, and every thew and fiber of the great beast strained as he hurtled along the boulder-strewn trail. But Conan sat easily, almost carelessly, in the saddle, riding like a centaur.

_*YASMINA*_
You hill-bred dog! _(she panted, quivering with the impact of shame, anger, and the realization of helplessness.)_ You dare—you *dare*! Your life shall pay for this! Where are you taking me?

_*CONAN*_
To the villages of Afghulistan. _(He cast a glance over his shoulder.)_

Behind them, beyond the slopes they had traversed, torches were tossing on the walls of the fortress, and he glimpsed a flare of light that meant the great gate had been opened. And he laughed, a deep-throated boom gusty as the hill wind.

_*CONAN*_
The governor has sent his riders after us. By Crom, we will lead him a merry chase! What do you think, Devi—will they pay seven lives for a Kshatriya princess?

_*YASMINA*_
They will send an army to hang you and your spawn of devils, _(she promised with conviction.)_

He laughed gustily and shifted her to a more comfortable position in his arms. But she took this as a fresh outrage, and renewed her vain struggle, until she saw that her efforts were only amusing him. Besides, her light silken garments, floating on the wind, were being outrageously disarranged by her struggles. She concluded that a scornful submission was the better part of dignity, and lapsed into a smoldering quiescence.

She felt even her anger being submerged by awe as they entered the mouth of the Pass, lowering like a black well mouth in the blacker walls that rose like colossal ramparts to bar their way. It was as if a gigantic knife had cut the Zhaibar out of walls of solid rock. On either hand sheer slopes pitched up for thousands of feet, and the mouth of the Pass was dark as hate. Even Conan could not see with any accuracy, but he knew the road, even by night. And knowing that armed men were racing through the starlight after him, he did not check the stallion’s speed.

Not even Conan could spy, in that darkness, an ambush set by Zhaibar tribesmen. As they swept past a black gorge mouth, a javelin swished through the air and thudded home behind the stallion’s shoulder. The beast died with a sob. Conan leaped clear, holding Yasmina aloft, landed catlike, thrust her into a cleft of rock, and wheeled toward the darkness, drawing his knife.

A vague shape rushed from the night, bare feet slapping, rags whipping. Steel flickered; stroke, parry, counter-stroke cracked in the dark. Conan’s knife split the attacker’s skull.

Out in the night men were moving and a stentorian voice roared:

_*UNKNOWN WAZULI*_
What, you dogs! Do you flinch? In, curse you, and take them!

Conan started, peered into the darkness and lifted his voice.

_*CONAN*_
Yar Afzal! Is it you?

A startled imprecation answered him, then:

_*YAR AFZAL*_
Conan? Is it you, Conan?

_*CONAN*_
Aye! Come forth, you old war-dog. I've slain one of your men.

There was movement among the rocks, and a flame bobbed toward them, lighting a fierce bearded face. More wild, ragged men pressed close, blades in fists.

_*YAR AFZAL*_
Aye, it is Conan! Come out of your rocks, dogs! It is Conan!

'What are you hunting in the Zhaibar by night, Yar Afzal?' Conan demanded.

_*YAR AFZAL*_
Who knows what might come up the Pass after dark? We Wazulis are night-hawks. But what of you, Conan?

_*CONAN*_
I have a prisoner. _(He moved aside and drew Yasmina forth.)_

Her imperious bearing gone, she cowered. The torch thrust near her face drew hissing breaths.

_*CONAN*_
She is my captive. _(He glanced at the slain man’s feet.)_ I was taking her to Afghulistan, but now you have slain my horse, and the Kshatriyas are close behind me.

_*YAR AFZAL*_
Come with us to my village. We have horses hidden in the gorge. They can never follow us in the darkness. They are close behind you, you say?

_*CONAN*_
So close that I hear now the clink of their hoofs on the flint.

Instantly the torch was dashed out and the shapes melted into the dark. Conan swept up the Devi and she did not resist…

They reached the gorge mouth, where horses stirred. Conan mounted the horse of the man he had slain, lifting the girl in front of him, and the band swept away like phantoms.

Yasmina, snuggled warmly in his arms, grew drowsy. Darkness, stars, vast walls, winds of dizzy heights, clink of hoofs, creak of saddles—all blurred into dream.

She vaguely felt being lifted down, laid on something soft, a cloak tucked around her.

_*YAR AFZAL*_
A rare prize, Conan; fit mate for a chief of the Afghulis.

_*CONAN*_
Not for me. This wench will buy the lives of my seven headmen, blast their souls.

She sank into dreamless slumber.

She slept while armed men rode through the dark hills and the fate of kingdoms hung in the balance…

A band of riders waited in a black pitmouth of a gorge. Their leader, a well-built man in a helmet and gilt-braided cloak, raised his hand until hoofbeats passed.

_*LEADER*_
They must have lost the trail! Or else they have found that Conan has already reached the Afghuli villages. It will take many riders to smoke out that hive. There will be squadrons riding up the Zhaibar by dawn.

_*IRAKZAI RIDER*_
If there is fighting in the hills there will be looting.

_*LEADER*_
There will be looting. But first it is our business to reach the valley of Gurashah and await the riders galloping southward from Secunderam before daylight.

He lifted his reins and rode out, his men falling in behind him—thirty ragged phantoms in the starlight.
