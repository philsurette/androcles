## 5 The Black Stallion ##

The sun was well up when Yasmina awoke. She did not start and stare blankly, wondering where she was. She awoke with full knowledge of all that had occurred. Her supple limbs were stiff from her long ride, and her firm flesh seemed to feel the contact of the muscular arm that had borne her so far.

She was lying on a sheepskin covering a pallet of leaves on a hard-beaten dirt floor. A folded sheepskin coat was under her head, and she was wrapped in a ragged cloak. She was in a large room, the walls of which were crudely but strongly built of uncut rocks, plastered with sun-baked mud. Heavy beams supported a roof of the same kind, in which showed a trap-door up to which led a ladder. There were no windows in the thick walls, only loop-holes. There was one door, a sturdy bronze affair that must have been looted from some Vendhyan border tower. Opposite it was a wide opening in the wall, with no door, but several strong wooden bars in place. Beyond them Yasmina saw a magnificent black stallion munching a pile of dried grass. The building was fort, dwelling-place and stable in one.

At the other end of the room a girl in the vest and baggy trousers of a hill-woman squatted beside a small fire, cooking strips of meat on an iron grid laid over blocks of stone. There was a sooty cleft in the wall a few feet from the floor, and some of the smoke found its way out there. The rest floated in blue wisps about the room.

The hill-girl glanced at Yasmina over her shoulder, displaying a bold, handsome face, and then continued her cooking. Voices boomed outside; then the door was kicked open, and Conan strode in. He looked more enormous than ever with the morning sunlight behind him, and Yasmina noted some details that had escaped her the night before. His garments were clean and not ragged. The broad Bakhariot girdle that supported his knife in its ornamented scabbard would have matched the robes of a prince, and there was a glint of fine Turanian mail under his shirt.

_*WAZULI GIRL*_
Your captive is awake, Conan.

Conan grunted, strode up to the fire and swept the strips of mutton off into a stone dish.

The squatting girl laughed up at him, with some spicy jest, and he grinned wolfishly, and hooking a toe under her haunches, tumbled her sprawling onto the floor. She seemed to derive considerable amusement from this bit of rough horse-play, but Conan paid no more heed to her. Producing a great hunk of bread from somewhere, with a copper jug of wine, he carried the lot to Yasmina, who had risen from her pallet and was regarding him doubtfully.

_*CONAN*_
Rough fare for a Devi, girl, but our best. It will fill your belly, at least.

He set the platter on the floor, and she was suddenly aware of a ravenous hunger. Making no comment, she seated herself cross-legged on the floor, and taking the dish in her lap, she began to eat. After all, adaptability is one of the tests of true aristocracy. Conan stood looking down at her, his thumbs hooked in his girdle. He never sat cross-legged, after the Eastern fashion.

_*YASMINA*_
Where am I?

_*CONAN*_
In the hut of Yar Afzal, the chief of the Khurum Wazulis. Afghulistan lies a good many miles farther on to the west. We'll hide here awhile. The Kshatriyas are beating up the hills for you—several of their squads have been cut up by the tribes already.

_*YASMINA*_
What are you going to do?

_*CONAN*_
Keep you until Chunder Shan is willing to trade back my seven cow-thieves. Women of the Wazulis are crushing ink out of *shoki* leaves, and after a while you can write a letter to the governor.

A touch of her old imperious wrath shook her. She flung down the dish and sprang to her feet, tense with anger.

_*YASMINA*_
I will not write a letter! If you do not take me back, they will hang your seven men, and a thousand more besides!

The Wazuli girl laughed mockingly. Conan scowled. Then the door opened and Yar Afzal came swaggering in. The Wazuli chief was as tall as Conan, and of greater girth, but he looked fat and slow beside the hard compactness of the Cimmerian. He plucked his red-stained beard and stared meaningly at the Wazuli girl, and that wench rose and scurried out. Then Yar Afzal turned to his guest.

_*YAR AFZAL*_
The damnable people murmur, Conan. They wish me to murder you and take the girl to hold for ransom. They say that anyone can tell by her garments that she is a noble lady. They say why should the Afghuli dogs profit by her, when it is the people who take the risk of guarding her?

_*CONAN*_
Lend me your horse. I'll take her and go.

_*YAR AFZAL*_
Pish! Do you think I can't handle my own people? I'll have them dancing in their shirts if they cross me! They don't love you—or any other outlander—but you saved my life once. Come out, though, Conan; a scout has returned.

Conan followed him outside. Yasmina peered through a loop-hole.

A Wazuli scout sat cross-legged before the circle of warriors.

_*SCOUT*_
I talked with a Dagozai who saw the riders last night. He was lurking near when they came to the spot where we ambushed the lord Conan. He overheard their speech. Chunder Shan was with them. They found the dead horse, and one of the men recognized it as Conan's. Then they found the man Conan slew, and knew him for a Wazuli. It seemed to them that Conan had been slain and the girl taken by the Wazuli; so they turned aside from their purpose of following to Afghulistan. But they did not know from which village the dead man was come, and we had left no trail a Kshatriya could follow.

So they rode to the nearest Wazuli village, Jugra, and burnt it and slew many. But the men of Khojur fell upon them and slew some, wounding the governor. They retired down the Zhaibar before dawn, returned with reinforcements before sunrise, and there has been fighting in the hills all morning. A great army is being raised to sweep the hills. Moreover, Kerim Shah has returned to the hills.

Yasmina leaned closer at that name.

_*YAR AFZAL*_
Where went he?

_*SCOUT*_
The Dagozai did not know. With him were thirty Irakzai of the lower villages. They rode into the hills and disappeared.

_*YAR AFZAL*_
These Irakzai are jackals that follow a lion for crumbs. They lap up the coins Kerim Shah scatters to buy men like horses. I like him not, for all he is our kinsman from Iranistan.

_*CONAN*_
He's not even that. I know him of old. He's a Hyrkanian, a spy of Yezdigerd's. If I catch him I'll hang his hide to a tamarisk.

_*WARRIORS*_
But the Kshatriyas! Are we to squat on our haunches until they smoke us out?

_*YAR AFZAL*_
Let them come. We can hold the defiles against a host.

One man leaped up, shaking his fist at Conan.

_*AGITATOR*_
Are we to take all the risks while he reaps the rewards? Are we to fight his battles for him?

Conan strode to him, staring full into his face.

_*CONAN*_
I ask no man to fight my battles. Draw your blade if you dare, you yapping dog!

_*AGITATOR*_
Dare to touch me and here are fifty men to rend you apart!

_*YAR AFZAL*_
What! Are you chief of Khurum? Do the Wazulis take orders from Yar Afzal, or from a low-bred cur?

He choked the man, hurled him to the ground, then kicked him savagely.

_*YAR AFZAL*_
Get down the valley to the watchers on the heights and bring word if they have seen anything.

The man went, shaking with fear.

He soon encountered a man in a camel-hair robe and green turban. Their eyes met—  
and froze the Wazuli in his tracks.

After minutes, the man drew a symbol in the dust and a black jade ball appeared. He tossed it to the Wazuli.

_*KHEMSA (UNRECOGNIZED BY WAZULIS)*_
Carry this to Yar Afzal.

The entranced man returned to the village.

Back before the hut, Yar Afzal halted mid-tirade as the man approached silently, arm outstretched, holding the jade ball. Conan murmured a warning, but too late.

Yar Afzal struck the man, the ball rolled to his foot. He picked it up—

—and felt movement in his hand.

He stared, horrified. A bellow of agony burst from him. He fell. A black jade-bodied spider crawled from his fingers and vanished into a crevice.

The tribesmen reeled back.

Then a voice rang out—a command from nowhere:

_*VOICE OF COMMAND*_
Yar Afzal is dead! Kill the outlander!

The Wazulis charged.

Conan sprang for the door. He slew and parried, dragging a dead man inside and slamming the door. Blades hacked at the bronze. A tree trunk smashed against it. The stallion screamed and struck.

Inside, Conan fought a tribesman who had entered with him.

Yasmina ran forward as Conan rose from beneath the corpse.

_*YASMINA*_
Oh, you live! I thought—I thought you were dead!

_*CONAN*_
Why are you trembling? Why should you care if I live or die?

_*YASMINA*_
You are preferable to those wolves howling without.

The door-sill splintered.

Conan tore into the stall, seized the maddened stallion, dragged him down by main strength, bridled and saddled him.

He worked at the stone wall.

_*CONAN*_
A secret door—Yar Afzal showed it to me once when he was drunk. It opens into the ravine behind the hut. Ha!

The wall slid open.

He hauled Yasmina onto the stallion, vaulted up—

—and the Wazulis burst through the door behind them.

The stallion shot through the opening like a javelin.

In the ravine mouth, a man in a green turban was unable to leap aside. He fell under the hoofs. A girl screamed. Conan glimpsed her as they thundered by—a slim, dark girl in silk trousers and a jeweled breast-band.

Then horse and riders vanished up the gorge, and the men who stormed after them met something that changed their yells of blood-lust to screams of fear and death.
