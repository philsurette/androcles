## 6 The Mountain of the Black Seers ##

'Where now?' Yasmina was trying to sit erect on the rocking saddle-bow, clutching her captor. She was conscious of a recognition of shame that she should not find unpleasant the feel of his muscular flesh under her fingers.

_*CONAN*_
To Afghulistan. It's a perilous road, but the stallion will carry us easily, unless we fall in with some of your friends, or my tribal enemies. Now that Yar Afzal is dead, those damned Wazulis will be on our heels. I'm surprized we haven't sighted them behind us already.

_*YASMINA*_
Who was that man you rode down?

_*CONAN*_
I don't know. I never saw him before. He's no Ghuli, that's certain. What the devil he was doing there is more than I can say. There was a girl with him, too.

_*YASMINA*_
Yes. _(Her gaze was shadowed.)_ I can not understand that. That girl was my maid, Gitara. Do you suppose she was coming to aid me? That the man was a friend? If so, the Wazulis have captured them both.

_*CONAN*_
Well, there's nothing we can do. If we go back, they'll skin us both. I can't understand how a girl like that could get this far into the mountains with only one man—and he a robed scholar, for that's what he looked like. There's something infernally queer in all this. That fellow Yar Afzal beat and sent away—he moved like a man walking in his sleep. I've seen the priests of Zamora perform their abominable rituals in their forbidden temples, and their victims had a stare like that man. The priests looked into their eyes and muttered incantations, and then the people became the walking dead men, with glassy eyes, doing as they were ordered.

And then I saw what the fellow had in his hand, which Yar Afzal picked up. It was like a big black jade bead, such as the temple girls of Yezud wear when they dance before the black stone spider which is their god. Yar Afzal held it in his hand, and he didn't pick up anything else. Yet when he fell dead, a spider, like the god at Yezud, only smaller, ran out of his fingers. And then, when the Wazulis stood uncertain there, a voice cried out for them to kill me, and I know that voice didn't come from any of the warriors, nor from the women who watched by the huts. It seemed to come from *above*.

Yasmina did not reply. She glanced at the stark outlines of the mountains all about them and shuddered. Her soul shrank from their gaunt brutality. This was a grim, naked land where anything might happen. Age-old traditions invested it with shuddery horror for anyone born in the hot, luxuriant southern plains.

The sun was high, beating down with fierce heat, yet the wind that blew in fitful gusts seemed to sweep off slopes of ice. Once she heard a strange rushing above them that was not the sweep of the wind, and from the way Conan looked up, she knew it was not a common sound to him, either. She thought that a strip of the cold blue sky was momentarily blurred, as if some all but invisible object had swept between it and herself, but she could not be sure. Neither made any comment, but Conan loosened his knife in his scabbard.

They were following a faintly marked path dipping down into ravines so deep the sun never struck bottom, laboring up steep slopes where loose shale threatened to slide from beneath their feet, and following knife-edge ridges with blue-hazed echoing depths on either hand.

The sun had passed its zenith when they crossed a narrow trail winding among the crags. Conan reined the horse aside and followed it southward, going almost at right angles to their former course.

_*CONAN*_
A Galzai village is at one end of this trail. Their women follow it to a well, for water. You need new garments.

Glancing down at her filmy attire, Yasmina agreed. Her slippers were in tatters, her silk robes torn.

Coming to a crook in the trail, Conan dismounted, helped her down and waited.

_*CONAN*_
A woman coming along the trail. _(He nodded, though she heard nothing.)_

_*YASMINA*_
You will not—not kill her?

_*CONAN*_
I don't kill women ordinarily; though some of the hill-women are she-wolves. No— _(he grinned as at a huge jest.)_ By Crom, I'll *pay* for her clothes! How is that?

Presently a tall, slim Galzai girl appeared, bearing a great empty gourd. She froze, then stood still in fear.

Conan displayed the gold coin.

_*CONAN*_
If you will give this woman your garments, I will give you this money.

The girl instantly stripped herself and handed her garments to Conan. He passed them to Yasmina.

_*CONAN*_
Get behind that rock and put these on. Fold your robes into a bundle and bring them to me.

_*GALZAI GIRL*_
The money! _(she clamored, stretching out her hands.)_ The gold you promised me!

Conan flipped the coin to her; she bit it and went on down the path with her gourd.

Yasmina dressed behind the rock. When she emerged, Conan swore in amazement and stared with burning admiration.

He turned her about, staring from all angles.

_*CONAN*_
By Crom! In those smoky, mystic robes you were aloof and cold and far off as a star! Now you are a woman of warm flesh and blood! You went behind that rock as the Devi of Vendhya; you come out as a hill-girl—though a thousand times more beautiful than any wench of the Zhaibar! You were a goddess—now you are real!

He spanked her, and she did not feel outraged.

He hurled the bundle of her robes over a cliff into a gorge.

_*YASMINA*_
Why did you do that? Why did you not give them to the girl?

_*CONAN*_
The riders from Peshkhauri are combing these hills. If they found a girl wearing your garments, they’d torture her into talking, and she might put them on my trail.

_*YASMINA*_
What will she do?

_*CONAN*_
Go back to her village and tell her people that a stranger attacked her. She’ll have them on our track. But she had to get the water first; if she dared go back without it, they’d whip the skin off her. That gives us a long start. They'll never catch us. By nightfall we'll cross the Afghuli border.

_*YASMINA*_
There are no paths or signs of human habitation in these parts. Even for the Himelians this region seems deserted.

Conan pointed northwest, where a peak appeared in a notch of the crags.

_*CONAN*_
Yimsha. The tribes build their villages as far as they can from the mountain.

_*YASMINA*_
Yimsha! The mountain of the Black Seers!

_*CONAN*_
So they say. This is as near as I ever came. I swung north to avoid Kshatriya troops. The regular trail lies farther south. This is an ancient one, seldom used.

She stared at the peak with hatred.

_*YASMINA*_
How long would it take to reach Yimsha from this point?

_*CONAN*_
All the rest of the day, and all night. Do you want to go there? By Crom, it's no place for ordinary humans, from what the hill-people say.

_*YASMINA*_
Why do they not gather and destroy the devils that inhabit it?

_*CONAN*_
Wipe out wizards with swords? Anyway, they never interfere unless people meddle with them. I've talked with men who swore they'd glimpsed tall silent men in black robes at sunrise or sunset.

_*YASMINA*_
Would you be afraid to attack them?

_*CONAN*_
I? If they imposed on me, it would be my life or theirs. But I have nothing to do with them. I came here to raise a following of human beings, not to war with wizards.

She considered this, staring at the peak. She stiffened suddenly and pointed.

_*YASMINA*_
Look!

A frosty crimson cloud veined with gold hovered over the peak, rotating, contracting, then detaching itself to float out and vanish.

_*YASMINA*_
What could that have been?

_*CONAN*_
The hill-men call it Yimsha's Carpet, whatever that means. I've seen five hundred of them run to hide in caves because they saw that crimson cloud float up—

They emerged onto a broad ledge. The stallion halted, refusing to advance.

Conan dismounted, tried to lead the horse; it neighed and jerked back.

Then Yasmina cried out. A man in a camel-hair robe and green turban stood there. Conan recognized him.

_*CONAN*_
Who the devil are you?

The man did not answer. His wide, luminous eyes held Conan's.

Conan felt the hypnotic force—but shook it off.

He lunged with his knife. Yasmina did not see how Khemsa avoided the blow. Conan went down like an ox.

Conan slashed upward even as he fell, forcing Khemsa to leap back.

Yasmina cried out as Gitara emerged. The malevolence in Gitara’s beautiful face froze her heart.

Conan rose slowly, shaken. Khemsa watched him warily, perhaps uncertain for the first time.

Then all froze, staring upward.

A crimson conoid cloud whirled down the mountain.

Khemsa trembled; his hand dropped; he pushed Gitara back.

The cloud struck the ledge—  
and vanished.

Four tall, shaven-headed men in black robes stood where it had been.

Conan backed to the stallion; Yasmina crept into his arm.

The men stared silently at Khemsa. He shook like a man in an ague, sweat streaming. His fingers dug into Gitara’s shoulder.

Khemsa fought the four titanic wills with all the black power they had taught him. He reeled but held.

Gitara was his anchor to humanity—  
and they knew it.

One shifted his gaze to her. She wilted. Her eyes glassy, she backed toward the precipice.

Khemsa staggered after her, divided and doomed.

She reached the brink.

He crawled toward her.

A wizard laughed.

Reason flooded back into Gitara’s eyes—terrified, pleading—  
and she fell with a moaning cry.

Khemsa stared over the edge, then turned on his tormentors.

He rushed with a knife.

A wizard stamped his foot.

A crevice split the ledge. A section sheared away.

Khemsa vanished with the avalanche.

The wizards turned toward Conan.

He moved sluggishly, befogged.

The four raised their arms; crimson smoke rose around them.

It enveloped Conan.

Yasmina screamed; the stallion shrieked.

She was torn from his arm.

A terrific blow hurled Conan against a rock.

A crimson cloud spun away up the slopes—  
and Yasmina was gone.
