## 7: On to Yimsha ##

As mists vanish before a strong wind, the cobwebs vanished from Conan’s brain. With a searing curse he leaped into the saddle and the stallion reared neighing beneath him. He glared up the slopes, hesitated, and then turned down the trail in the direction he had been going when halted by Khemsa’s trickery. But now he did not ride at a measured gait. He shook loose the reins and the stallion went like a thunderbolt, as if frantic to lose hysteria in violent physical exertion. Across the ledge and around the crag and down the narrow trail threading the great steep they plunged at breakneck speed. The path followed a fold of rock, winding interminably down from tier to tier of striated escarpment, and once, far below, Conan got a glimpse of the ruin that had fallen—a mighty pile of broken stone and boulders at the foot of a gigantic cliff.

The valley floor was still far below him when he reached a long and lofty ridge that led out from the slope like a natural causeway. Out upon this he rode, with an almost sheer drop on either hand. He could trace ahead of him the trail and made a great horseshoe back into the river-bed at his left hand. He cursed the necessity of traversing those miles, but it was the only way. To try to descend to the lower lap of the trail here would be to attempt the impossible. Only a bird could get to the river-bed with a whole neck.

So he urged on the wearying stallion, until a clink of hoofs reached his ears, welling up from below. Pulling up short and reining to the lip of the cliff, he stared down into the dry river-bed that wound along the foot of the ridge. Along that gorge rode a motley throng—bearded men on half-wild horses, five hundred strong, bristling with weapons. And Conan shouted suddenly, leaning over the edge of the cliff, three hundred feet above them.

At his shout they reined back, and five hundred bearded faces were tilted up towards him; a deep, clamorous roar filled the canyon. Conan did not waste words.

_*CONAN*_
‘I was riding for Ghor!’ he roared. ‘I had not hoped to meet you dogs on the trail. Follow me as fast as your nags can push! I’m going to Yimsha, and—’

_*AFGHULI WARRIOR*_
‘Traitor!’

_*CONAN*_
‘What?’

He glared down at them, jolted speechless. He saw wild eyes blazing up at him, faces contorted with fury, fists brandishing blades.

_*AFGHULI WARRIOR*_
‘Traitor! Where are the seven chiefs held captive in Peshkhauri?’

_*CONAN*_
‘Why, in the governor’s prison, I suppose.’

A bloodthirsty yell from a hundred throats answered him, with such a waving of weapons and a clamor that he could not understand what they were saying. He beat down the din with a bull-like roar.

_*CONAN*_
‘What devil’s play is this? Let one of you speak, so I can understand what you mean!’

_*AFGHULI WARRIOR*_
‘You would not let us go raiding Peshkhauri to rescue our brothers!’

_*CONAN*_
‘No, you fools! Even if you’d breached the wall, which is unlikely, they’d have hanged the prisoners before you could reach them.’

_*AFGHULI WARRIOR*_
‘And you went alone to traffic with the governor!’

_*CONAN*_
‘Well?’

_*AFGHULI WARRIOR*_
‘Where are the seven chiefs? Dead!’

_*CONAN*_
‘What!’

_*AFGHULI WARRIOR*_
‘Aye, dead!’

_*AFGHULI WARRIOR*_
‘They were not hanged! A Wazuli in another cell saw them die! The governor sent a wizard to slay them by craft!’

_*CONAN*_
‘That must be a lie. The governor would not dare. Last night I talked with him—’

A yell of hate and accusation split the skies.

_*AFGHULI WARRIOR*_
‘Aye! You went to him alone! To betray us! It is no lie. The Wazuli escaped and told the tale to our scouts. When they heard it, they returned with all haste to Ghor—and we saddled our steeds and girt our swords!’

_*CONAN*_
‘And what do you fools mean to do?’

_*AFGHULI WARRIOR*_
‘To avenge our brothers! Death to the Kshatriyas! Slay him, brothers—he is a traitor!’

Arrows began to rattle around him. Conan rose in his stirrups, striving to make himself heard above the tumult; and then, with a roar of mingled rage, defiance and disgust, he wheeled and galloped back up the trail.

Behind him and below him the Afghulis came pelting, mouthing their rage, too furious even to remember that the only way they could reach the height whereon he rode was to traverse the river-bed in the other direction, make the broad bend, and follow the twisting trail up over the ridge. When they did remember this, and turned back, their repudiated chief had almost reached the point where the ridge joined the escarpment.

At the cliff he did not take the trail by which he had descended, but turned off on another, a mere trace along a rock-fault, where the stallion scrambled for footing. He had not ridden far when the stallion snorted and shied back from something lying in the trail. Conan stared down on the travesty of a man, a broken, shredded, bloody heap that gibbered and gnashed splintered teeth.

Impelled by some obscure reason, Conan dismounted and stood looking down at the ghastly shape, knowing that he was witness of a thing miraculous and opposed to nature. The Rakhsha lifted his gory head, and his strange eyes, glazed with agony and approaching death, rested on Conan with recognition.

_*KHEMSA*_
'Where are they?' It was a racking croak not even remotely resembling a human voice.

_*CONAN*_
'Gone back to their damnable castle on Yimsha. They took the Devi with them.'

_*KHEMSA*_
'I will go! I will follow them! They killed Gitara; I will kill them—the acolytes, the Four of the Black Circle, the Master himself! Kill—kill them all!'

'He strove to drag his mutilated frame along the rock, but not even his indomitable will could animate that gory mass longer, where the splintered bones hung together only by torn tissue and ruptured fibre.'

_*KHEMSA*_
'Follow them! Follow!'

_*CONAN*_
'I'm going to. I went to fetch my Afghulis, but they've turned on me. I'm going on to Yimsha alone. I'll have the Devi back if I have to tear down that damned mountain with my bare hands. I didn't think the governor would dare kill my headmen, when I had the Devi, but it seems he did. I'll have his head for that. She's no use to me now as a hostage, but—'

_*KHEMSA*_
'The curse of Yizil on them! Go! I am dying. Wait—take my girdle.'

He tried to fumble with a mangled hand at his tatters, and Conan, understanding what he sought to convey, bent and drew from about his gory waist a girdle of curious aspect.

_*KHEMSA*_
'Follow the golden vein through the abyss. Wear the girdle. I had it from a Stygian priest. It will aid you, though it failed me at last. Break the crystal globe with the four golden pomegranates. Beware of the Master's transmutations— I am going to Gitara—she is waiting for me in hell—*aie, ya Skelos yar!*'

And so he died.

Conan stared down at the girdle. The hair of which it was woven was not horsehair. He was convinced that it was woven of the thick black tresses of a woman. Set in the thick mesh were tiny jewels such as he had never seen before. The buckle was strangely made, in the form of a golden serpent-head, flat, wedge-shaped and scaled with curious art. A strong shudder shook Conan as he handled it, and he turned as though to cast it over the precipice; then he hesitated, and finally buckled it about his waist, under the Bakhariot girdle. Then he mounted and pushed on.

The sun had sunk behind the crags. He climbed the trail in the vast shadow of the cliffs that was thrown out like a dark blue mantle over valleys and ridges far below. He was not far from the crest when, edging around the shoulder of a jutting crag, he heard the clink of shod hoofs ahead of him. He did not turn back. Indeed, so narrow was the path that the stallion could not have wheeled his great body upon it. He rounded the jut of the rock and came upon a portion of the path that broadened somewhat. A chorus of threatening yells broke on his ear, but his stallion pinned a terrified horse hard against the rock, and Conan caught the arm of the rider in an iron grip, checking the lifted sword in midair.

_*CONAN*_
'Kerim Shah!'

The Turanian did not struggle; they sat their horses almost breast to breast, Conan's fingers locking the other's sword-arm. Behind Kerim Shah filed a group of lean Irakzai on gaunt horses. They glared like wolves, fingering bows and knives, but rendered uncertain because of the narrowness of the path and the perilous proximity of the abyss that yawned beneath them.

_*KERIM SHAH*_
'Where is the Devi?'

_*CONAN*_
'What's it to you, you Hyrkanian spy?'

_*KERIM SHAH*_
'I know you have her. I was on my way northward with some tribesmen when we were ambushed in Shalizah Pass. Many were slain, and the rest of us harried through the hills like jackals. We turned westward toward Amir Jehun Pass, and this morning we came upon a Wazuli wandering through the hills. He was quite mad, but I learned much from his gibberings before he died. I learned he was the sole survivor of a band which followed a chief of the Afghulis and a captive Kshatriya woman into a gorge behind Khurum village. He babbled much of a man in a green turban whom the Afghuli rode down, but who, when attacked by Wazulis, smote them with a nameless doom that wiped them out as wind-driven fire wipes out locusts.'

_*KERIM SHAH*_
'How that one man escaped, I do not know; but I knew from his maunderings that Conan of Ghor had been in Khurum with his captive. Later we overtook a naked Galzai girl bearing water, who told us she had been stripped and ravished by a giant foreigner in Afghuli garb, who gave her garments to a Vendhyan woman. She said you rode westward.'

Kerim Shah did not consider it necessary to explain that he had been on his way to keep a rendezvous with the expected troops from Secunderam when he found his way barred by hostile tribesmen. Barred from the Shalizah road, he had turned to the forbidden route, until news that Conan had not yet reached Afghulistan with his captive caused him to turn southward and push recklessly in the hope of overtaking the Cimmerian.

_*KERIM SHAH*_
'So you had better tell me where the Devi is. We outnumber you—'

_*CONAN*_
'Let one of your dogs nock a shaft and I'll throw you over the cliff. It wouldn't do you any good to kill me. Five hundred Afghulis are on my trail; if they find you’ve cheated them, they'll flay you alive. Anyway, I haven't got the Devi. She's in the hands of the Black Seers of Yimsha.'

_*KERIM SHAH*_
'*Tarim!* Khemsa—'

_*CONAN*_
'Khemsa's dead. His masters sent him to hell on a landslide. And now get out of my way. I'd be glad to kill you if I had the time, but I'm on my way to Yimsha.'

_*KERIM SHAH*_
'I'll go with you.'

_*CONAN*_
'Do you think I'd trust you, you Hyrkanian dog?'

_*KERIM SHAH*_
'I don't ask you to. We both want the Devi. You know my reason; King Yezdigerd desires to add her kingdom to his empire, and herself to his seraglio. And I know *your* ambition—loot. You want to plunder Vendhya and ransom Yasmina. So—let us unite, without illusions, and try to rescue her. If we live, we can fight afterward to see who keeps her.'

Conan scrutinized him, then nodded. 'Agreed. What about your men?'

_*KERIM SHAH*_
'This chief and I are going to Yimsha to fight the wizards. Will you go with us, or stay to be flayed by the Afghulis following him?'

_*IRAKZAI RIDERS*_
'We will go with thee and die on Yimsha.'

_*CONAN*_
'Then in Crom's name let us be gone. My wolves were hours behind me, but we've lost a devilish lot of time.'

Kerim Shah backed his steed from between the stallion and the cliff, sheathing his sword. The band filed up the path as swiftly as they dared. They came out upon the crest nearly a mile east of the spot where Khemsa had halted the Cimmerian and the Devi. The path they had traversed was perilous even for hill-men, which was why Conan had avoided it when carrying Yasmina, though Kerim Shah had taken it, supposing Conan had done likewise. Even Conan sighed with relief when the horses scrambled over the last rim. They moved like phantom riders through an enchanted realm of shadows. The soft creak of leather and the clink of steel marked their passing; then again the dark mountain slopes lay naked and silent in the starlight.
