## 8: Yasmina Knows Stark Terror ##

Yasmina had time but for one scream when she felt herself envelo...n of natural sensations gone mad, and then vertigo and oblivion.

A vestige of these sensations clung to her as she recovered cons...stability pervaded her. She took cognizance of her surroundings.

She was lying on a dais covered with black velvet. This dais sto...ment, yet which invaded her mind with a dim and formless terror.

But her gaze fixed itself on a tangible object. On another, smal...her, nor did his expression alter when he saw she was conscious.

Yasmina felt fear crawl like a trickle of ice-water down her sup...herself on her elbows and stared apprehensively at the stranger.

_*YASMINA*_
Who are you? _(she demanded. Her voice sounded brittle and inadequate.)_

_*FIRST SEER*_
I am the Master of Yimsha. _(The tone was rich and resonant, like the mellow tones of a temple bell.)_

_*YASMINA*_
Why did you bring me here? _(she demanded.)_

_*FIRST SEER*_
Were you not seeking me?

_*YASMINA*_
If you are one of the Black Seers--yes! _(she answered recklessly, believing that he could read her thoughts anyway.)_

He laughed softly, and chills crawled up and down her spine again.

_*FIRST SEER*_
You would turn the wild children of the hills against the Seers...weak, human mind, filled with petty dreams of hate and revenge._

_*YASMINA*_
You slew my brother! _(A rising tide of anger was vying with her...dling in human affairs. Why did you destroy the king of Vendhya?)_

_*FIRST SEER*_
How can an ordinary human understand the motives of a Seer? _(returned the Master calmly.)_ My acolytes in the temples of Turan...ystic reasons to your puny intellect? You could not understand._

_*YASMINA*_
I understand this: that my brother died! _(Tears of grief and ra...g eyes, as supple and dangerous in that moment as a she-panther.)_

_*FIRST SEER*_
As Yezdigerd desired, _(agreed the Master calmly.)_ For a while it was my whim to further his ambitions.

_*YASMINA*_
Is Yezdigerd your vassal? _(Yasmina tried to keep the timbre of ...btly she shifted her position, moving her hand under the fold.)_

_*FIRST SEER*_
Is the dog that licks up the offal in the temple yard the vassal of the god? _(returned the Master.)_

_*FIRST SEER*_
I am weary of Yezdigerd, _(said the Master.)_ I have turned to other amusements--ha!

She dropped it as if it had been a viper, and scrambled away fro...her tormenter. She returned to her own dais, because that was a...and eyed him apprehensively, expecting reprisals.

But the Master made no move.

_*FIRST SEER*_
All substance is one to him who holds the key of the cosmos,...om in unnamed gardens, or flower-swords flash in the moonlight._

_*YASMINA*_
You are a devil, _(she sobbed.)_

_*FIRST SEER*_
Not I! _(he laughed. I was born on this planet, long ago. Once I...oom I guard them with ensorcelled crystal and golden serpents.)_

_*FIRST SEER*_
But only I can rule them. My foolish Khemsa thought to make him...ad not been destroyed his power might have grown to rival mine._

He laughed again.

_*FIRST SEER*_
And you, poor, silly thing! Plotting to send a hairy hill chief...o seduce by your feminine wiles to attempt your purpose, anyway._

_*FIRST SEER*_
But for all your stupidity, you are a woman fair to look upon. It is my whim to keep you for my slave.

The daughter of a thousand proud emperors gasped with shame and fury at the word.

_*YASMINA*_
You dare not!

His mocking laughter cut her like a whip across her naked shoulders.

_*FIRST SEER*_
The king dares not trample a worm in the road? Little fool, do y...es of the queens of Hell! You have seen how I deal with a rebel!

Cowed and awed, the girl crouched on the velvet-covered dais. Th...aster became shadowy. His voice took on a newer tone of command.

_*YASMINA*_
I will never yield to you! _(Her voice trembled with fear but it carried a ring of resolution.)_

_*FIRST SEER*_
You will yield, _(he answered with horrible conviction.)_ Fear a...and view all the shapes that have been you. *Aie, yil la khosa!*

At these words the shadowy room swam before Yasmina's affrighted...ion that the walls and ceiling had withdrawn immensely from her.

Then somewhere in the darkness a glow began, like a firefly that...atched, as it grows in the haunted, forbidden jungles of Khitai.

The broad leaves were murmurous with evil life. The blossoms ben...eble flicker of animate life like a candle blown out in a storm.

Then there came a period of blind impulse and movement, when the...d by formative forces until she emerged again a conscious indivi...whirling down an endless spiral of lives.

In a mist of terror she relived all her former existences, recog...and _was_ again all the bodies that had carried her ego througho...he changing ages. She bruised her feet again over the long, we...d of life that stretched out behind her into the immemorial past.

She knew the agonies of childbirth, and the bitterness of love b... as Yasmina, to whose pride the whip was like a white-hot brand.

Life merged into life in flying chaos, each with its burden of w...bly, like one long-drawn cry of suffering echoing down the ages.

Then she awakened on the velvet-covered dais in the mystic room.

In a ghostly gray light she saw again the dais and the cryptic r...t it was not the Master who sat so silently on that black dais.

Then the figure moved and rose upright, towering above her. It s...and decay--features like rotting parchment on a moldering skull.

She screamed again, and then, as those champing, grinning jaws bent toward her lips, she lost consciousness....
