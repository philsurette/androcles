## 6 The Mountain of the Black Seers

'Where now?' Yasmina was trying to sit erect on the rocking saddle-bow, clutching her captor. She was conscious of a recognition of shame that she should not find unpleasant the feel of his muscular flesh under her fingers.

'To Afghulistan,' he answered. 'It's a perilous road, but the stallion will carry us easily, unless we fall in with some of your friends, or my tribal enemies. Now that Yar Afzal is dead, those damned Wazulis will be on our heels. I'm surprized we haven't sighted them behind us already.'

'Who was that man you rode down?' she asked.

'I don't know. I never saw him before. He's no Ghuli, that's certain. What the devil he was doing there is more than I can say. There was a girl with him, too.'

'Yes.' Her gaze was shadowed. 'I can not understand that. That girl was my maid, Gitara. Do you suppose she was coming to aid me? That the man was a friend? If so, the Wazulis have captured them both.'

'Well,' he answered, 'there's nothing we can do. If we go back, they'll skin us both. I can't understand how a girl like that could get this far into the mountains with only one man--and he a robed scholar, for that's what he looked like. There's something infernally queer in all this. That fellow Yar Afzal beat and sent away--he moved like a man walking in his sleep. I've seen the priests of Zamora perform their abominable rituals in their forbidden temples, and their victims had a stare like that man. The priests looked into their eyes and muttered incantations, and then the people became the walking dead men, with glassy eyes, doing as they were ordered.

'And then I saw what the fellow had in his hand, which Yar Afzal picked up. It was like a big black jade bead, such as the temple girls of Yezud wear when they dance before the black stone spider which is their god. Yar Afzal held it in his hand, and he didn't pick up anything else. Yet when he fell dead, a spider, like the god at Yezud, only smaller, ran out of his fingers. And then, when the Wazulis stood uncertain there, a voice cried out for them to kill me, and I know that voice didn't come from any of the warriors, nor from the women who watched by the huts. It seemed to come from _above_.'

Yasmina did not reply. She glanced at the stark outlines of the mountains all about them and shuddered. Her soul shrank from their gaunt brutality. This was a grim, naked land where anything might happen. Age-old traditions invested it with shuddery horror for anyone born in the hot, luxuriant southern plains.

The sun was high, beating down with fierce heat, yet the wind that blew in fitful gusts seemed to sweep off slopes of ice. Once she heard a strange rushing above them that was not the sweep of the wind, and from the way Conan looked up, she knew it was not a common sound to him, either. She thought that a strip of the cold blue sky was momentarily blurred, as if some all but invisible object had swept between it and herself, but she could not be sure. Neither made any comment, but Conan loosened his knife in his scabbard.

They were following a faintly marked path dipping down into ravines so deep the sun never struck bottom, laboring up steep slopes where loose shale threatened to slide from beneath their feet, and following knife-edge ridges with blue-hazed echoing depths on either hand.

The sun had passed its zenith when they crossed a narrow trail winding among the crags. Conan reined the horse aside and followed it southward, going almost at right angles to their former course.

'A Galzai village is at one end of this trail,' he explained. 'Their women follow it to a well, for water. You need new garments.'

Glancing down at her filmy attire, Yasmina agreed with him. Her cloth-of-gold slippers were in tatters, her robes and silken under-garments torn to shreds that scarcely held together decently. Garments meant for the streets of Peshkhauri were scarcely appropriate for the crags of the Himelians.

Coming to a crook in the trail, Conan dismounted, helped Yasmina down and waited. Presently he nodded, though she heard nothing.

'A woman coming along the trail,' he remarked. In sudden panic she clutched his arm.

'You will not--not kill her?'

'I don't kill women ordinarily,' he grunted; 'though some of the hill-women are she-wolves. No,' he grinned as at a huge jest. 'By Crom, I'll _pay_ for her clothes! How is that?' He displayed a large handful of gold coins, and replaced all but the largest. She nodded, much relieved. It was perhaps natural for men to slay and die; her flesh crawled at the thought of watching the butchery of a woman.

Presently a woman appeared around the crook of the trail--a tall, slim Galzai girl, straight as a young sapling, bearing a great empty gourd. She stopped short and the gourd fell from her hands when she saw them; she wavered as though to run, then realized that Conan was too close to her to allow her to escape, and so stood still, staring at them with a mixed expression of fear and curiosity.

Conan displayed the gold coin.

'If you will give this woman your garments,' he said, 'I will give you this money.'

The response was instant. The girl smiled broadly with surprize and delight, and, with the disdain of a hill-woman for prudish conventions, promptly yanked off her sleeveless embroidered vest, slipped down her wide trousers and stepped out of them, twitched off her wide-sleeved shirt, and kicked off her sandals. Bundling them all in a bunch, she proffered them to Conan, who handed them to the astonished Devi.

'Get behind that rock and put these on,' he directed, further proving himself no native hillman. 'Fold your robes up into a bundle and bring them to me when you come out.'

'The money!' clamored the hill-girl, stretching out her hands eagerly. 'The gold you promised me!'

Conan flipped the coin to her, she caught it, bit, then thrust it into her hair, bent and caught up the gourd and went on down the path, as devoid of self-consciousness as of garments. Conan waited with some impatience while the Devi, for the first time in her pampered life, dressed herself. When she stepped from behind the rock he swore in surprize, and she felt a curious rush of emotions at the unrestrained admiration burning in his fierce blue eyes. She felt shame, embarrassment, yet a stimulation of vanity she had never before experienced, and a tingling when meeting the impact of his eyes. He laid a heavy hand on her shoulder and turned her about, staring avidly at her from all angles.

'By Crom!' said he. 'In those smoky, mystic robes you were aloof and cold and far off as a star! Now you are a woman of warm flesh and blood! You went behind that rock as the Devi of Vendhya; you come out as a hill-girl--though a thousand times more beautiful than any wench of the Zhaibar! You were a goddess--now you are real!'

He spanked her resoundingly, and she, recognizing this as merely another expression of admiration, did not feel outraged. It was indeed as if the changing of her garments had wrought a change in her personality. The feelings and sensations she had suppressed rose to domination in her now, as if the queenly robes she had cast off had been material shackles and inhibitions.

But Conan, in his renewed admiration, did not forget that peril lurked all about them. The farther they drew away from the region of the Zhaibar, the less likely he was to encounter any Kshatriya troops. On the other hand he had been listening all throughout their flight for sounds that would tell him the vengeful Wazulis of Khurum were on their heels.

Swinging the Devi up, he followed her into the saddle and again reined the stallion westward. The bundle of garments she had given him, he hurled over a cliff, to fall into the depths of a thousand-foot gorge.

'Why did you do that?' she asked. 'Why did you not give them to the girl?'

'The riders from Peshkhauri are combing these hills,' he said. 'They'll be ambushed and harried at every turn, and by way of reprisal they'll destroy every village they can take. They may turn westward any time. If they found a girl wearing your garments, they'd torture her into talking, and she might put them on my trail.'

'What will she do?' asked Yasmina.

'Go back to her village and tell her people that a stranger attacked her,' he answered. 'She'll have them on our track, all right. But she had to go on and get the water first; if she dared go back without it, they'd whip the skin off her. That gives us a long start. They'll never catch us. By nightfall we'll cross the Afghuli border.'

'There are no paths or signs of human habitation in these parts,' she commented. 'Even for the Himelians this region seems singularly deserted. We have not seen a trail since we left the one where we met the Galzai woman.'

For answer he pointed to the northwest, where she glimpsed a peak in a notch of the crags.

'Yimsha,' grunted Conan. 'The tribes build their villages as far from the mountain as they can.'

She was instantly rigid with attention.

'Yimsha!' she whispered. 'The mountain of the Black Seers!'

'So they say,' he answered. 'This is as near as I ever approached it. I have swung north to avoid any Kshatriya troops that might be prowling through the hills. The regular trail from Khurum to Afghulistan lies farther south. This is an ancient one, and seldom used.'

She was staring intently at the distant peak. Her nails bit into her pink palms.

'How long would it take to reach Yimsha from this point?'

'All the rest of the day, and all night,' he answered, and grinned. 'Do you want to go there? By Crom, it's no place for an ordinary human, from what the hill-people say.'

'Why do they not gather and destroy the devils that inhabit it?' she demanded.

'Wipe out wizards with swords? Anyway, they never interfere with people, unless the people interfere with them. I never saw one of them, though I've talked with men who swore they had. They say they've glimpsed people from the tower among the crags at sunset or sunrise--tall, silent men in black robes.'

'Would you be afraid to attack them?'

'I?' The idea seemed a new one to him. 'Why, if they imposed upon me, it would be my life or theirs. But I have nothing to do with them. I came to these mountains to raise a following of human beings, not to war with wizards.'

Yasmina did not at once reply. She stared at the peak as at a human enemy, feeling all her anger and hatred stir in her bosom anew. And another feeling began to take dim shape. She had plotted to hurl against the masters of Yimsha the man in whose arms she was now carried. Perhaps there was another way, besides the method she had planned, to accomplish her purpose. She could not mistake the look that was beginning to dawn in this wild man's eyes as they rested on her. Kingdoms have fallen when a woman's slim white hands pulled the strings of destiny. Suddenly she stiffened, pointing.

'Look!'

Just visible on the distant peak there hung a cloud of peculiar aspect. It was a frosty crimson in color, veined with sparkling gold. This cloud was in motion; it rotated, and as it whirled it contracted. It dwindled to a spinning taper that flashed in the sun. And suddenly it detached itself from the snow-tipped peak, floated out over the void like a gay-hued feather, and became invisible against the cerulean sky.

'What could that have been?' asked the girl uneasily, as a shoulder of rock shut the distant mountain from view; the phenomenon had been disturbing, even in its beauty.

'The hill-men call it Yimsha's Carpet, whatever that means,' answered Conan. 'I've seen five hundred of them running as if the devil were at their heels, to hide themselves in caves and crags, because they saw that crimson cloud float up from the peak. What in--'

They had advanced through a narrow, knife-cut gash between turreted walls and emerged upon a broad ledge, flanked by a series of rugged slopes on one hand, and a gigantic precipice on the other. The dim trail followed this ledge, bent around a shoulder and reappeared at intervals far below, working a tedious way downward. And emerging from the cut that opened upon the ledge, the black stallion halted short, snorting. Conan urged him on impatiently, and the horse snorted and threw his head up and down, quivering and straining as if against an invisible barrier.

Conan swore and swung off, lifting Yasmina down with him. He went forward, with a hand thrown out before him as if expecting to encounter unseen resistance, but there was nothing to hinder him, though when he tried to lead the horse, it neighed shrilly and jerked back. Then Yasmina cried out, and Conan wheeled, hand starting to knife-hilt.

Neither of them had seen him come, but he stood there, with his arms folded, a man in a camel-hair robe and a green turban. Conan grunted with surprize to recognize the man the stallion had spurned in the ravine outside the Wazuli village.

'Who the devil are you?' he demanded.

The man did not answer. Conan noticed that his eyes were wide, fixed, and of a peculiar luminous quality. And those eyes held his like a magnet.

Khemsa's sorcery was based on hypnotism, as is the case with most Eastern magic. The way has been prepared for the hypnotist for untold centuries of generations who have lived and died in the firm conviction of the reality and power of hypnotism, building up, by mass thought and practise, a colossal though intangible atmosphere against which the individual, steeped in the traditions of the land, finds himself helpless.

But Conan was not a son of the East. Its traditions were meaningless to him; he was the product of an utterly alien atmosphere. Hypnotism was not even a myth in Cimmeria. The heritage that prepared a native of the East for submission to the mesmerist was not his.

He was aware of what Khemsa was trying to do to him; but he felt the impact of the man's uncanny power only as a vague impulsion, a tugging and pulling that he could shake off as a man shakes spiderwebs from his garments.

Aware of hostility and black magic, he ripped out his long knife and lunged, as quick on his feet as a mountain lion.

But hypnotism was not all of Khemsa's magic. Yasmina, watching, did not see by what roguery of movement or illusion the man in the green turban avoided the terrible disembowelling thrust. But the keen blade whickered between side and lifted arm, and to Yasmina it seemed that Khemsa merely brushed his open palm lightly against Conan's bull-neck. But the Cimmerian went down like a slain ox.

Yet Conan was not dead; breaking his fall with his left hand, he slashed at Khemsa's legs even as he went down, and the Rakhsha avoided the scythe-like swipe only by a most unwizardly bound backward. Then Yasmina cried out sharply as she saw a woman she recognized as Gitara glide out from among the rocks and come up to the man. The greeting died in the Devi's throat as she saw the malevolence in the girl's beautiful face.

Conan was rising slowly, shaken and dazed by the cruel craft of that blow which, delivered with an art forgotten of men before Atlantis sank, would have broken like a rotten twig the neck of a lesser man. Khemsa gazed at him cautiously and a trifle uncertainly. The Rakhsha had learned the full flood of his own power when he faced at bay the knives of the maddened Wazulis in the ravine behind Khurum village; but the Cimmerian's resistance had perhaps shaken his new-found confidence a trifle. Sorcery thrives on success, not on failure.

He stepped forward, lifting his hand--then halted as if frozen, head tilted back, eyes wide open, hand raised. In spite of himself Conan followed his gaze, and so did the women--the girl cowering by the trembling stallion, and the girl beside Khemsa.

Down the mountain slopes, like a whirl of shining dust blown before the wind, a crimson, conoid cloud came dancing. Khemsa's dark face turned ashen; his hand began to tremble, then sank to his side. The girl beside him, sensing the change in him, stared at him inquiringly.

The crimson shape left the mountain slope and came down in a long arching sweep. It struck the ledge between Conan and Khemsa, and the Rakhsha gave back with a stifled cry. He backed away, pushing the girl Gitara back with groping, fending hands.

The crimson cloud balanced like a spinning top for an instant, whirling in a dazzling sheen on its point. Then without warning it was gone, vanished as a bubble vanishes when burst. There on the ledge stood four men. It was miraculous, incredible, impossible, yet it was true. They were not ghosts or phantoms. They were four tall men, with shaven, vulture-like heads, and black robes that hid their feet. Their hands were concealed by their wide sleeves. They stood in silence, their naked heads nodding slightly in unison. They were facing Khemsa, but behind them Conan felt his own blood turning to ice in his veins. Rising, he backed stealthily away, until he could feel the stallion's shoulder trembling against his back, and the Devi crept into the shelter of his arm. There was no word spoken. Silence hung like a stifling pall.

All four of the men in black robes stared at Khemsa. Their vulture-like faces were immobile, their eyes introspective and contemplative. But Khemsa shook like a man in an ague. His feet were braced on the rock, his calves straining as if in physical combat. Sweat ran in streams down his dark face. His right hand locked on something under his brown robe so desperately that the blood ebbed from that hand and left it white. His left hand fell on the shoulder of Gitara and clutched in agony like the grasp of a drowning man. She did not flinch or whimper, though his fingers dug like talons into her firm flesh.

Conan had witnessed hundreds of battles in his wild life, but never one like this, wherein four diabolical wills sought to beat down one lesser but equally devilish will that opposed them. But he only faintly sensed the monstrous quality of that hideous struggle. With his back to the wall, driven to bay by his former masters, Khemsa was fighting for his life with all the dark power, all the frightful knowledge they had taught him through long, grim years of neophytism and vassalage.

He was stronger than even he had guessed, and the free exercise of his powers in his own behalf had tapped unsuspected reservoirs of forces. And he was nerved to super-energy by frantic fear and desperation. He reeled before the merciless impact of those hypnotic eyes, but he held his ground. His features were distorted into a bestial grin of agony, and his limbs were twisted as on a rack. It was a war of souls, of frightful brains steeped in lore forbidden to men for a million years, of mentalities which had plumbed the abysses and explored the dark stars where spawn the shadows.

Yasmina understood this better than did Conan. And she dimly understood why Khemsa could withstand the concentrated impact of those four hellish wills which might have blasted into atoms the very rock on which he stood. The reason was the girl that he clutched with the strength of his despair. She was like an anchor to his staggering soul, battered by the waves of those psychic emanations. His weakness was now his strength. His love for the girl, violent and evil though it might be, was yet a tie that bound him to the rest of humanity, providing an earthly leverage for his will, a chain that his inhuman enemies could not break; at least not break through Khemsa.

They realized that before he did. And one of them turned his gaze from the Rakhsha full upon Gitara. There was no battle there. The girl shrank and wilted like a leaf in the drought. Irresistibly impelled, she tore herself from her lover's arms before he realized what was happening. Then a hideous thing came to pass. She began to back toward the precipice, facing her tormentors, her eyes wide and blank as dark gleaming glass from behind which a lamp has been blown out. Khemsa groaned and staggered toward her, falling into the trap set for him. A divided mind could not maintain the unequal battle. He was beaten, a straw in their hands. The girl went backward, walking like an automaton, and Khemsa reeled drunkenly after her, hands vainly outstretched, groaning, slobbering in his pain, his feet moving heavily like dead things.

On the very brink she paused, standing stiffly, her heels on the edge, and he fell on his knees and crawled whimpering toward her, groping for her, to drag her back from destruction. And just before his clumsy fingers touched her, one of the wizards laughed, like the sudden, bronze note of a bell in hell. The girl reeled suddenly and, consummate climax of exquisite cruelty, reason and understanding flooded back into her eyes, which flared with awful fear. She screamed, clutched wildly at her lover's straining hand, and then, unable to save herself, fell headlong with a moaning cry.

Khemsa hauled himself to the edge and stared over, haggardly, his lips working as he mumbled to himself. Then he turned and stared for a long minute at his torturers, with wide eyes that held no human light. And then with a cry that almost burst the rocks, he reeled up and came rushing toward them, a knife lifted in his hand.

One of the Rakhshas stepped forward and stamped his foot, and as he stamped, there came a rumbling that grew swiftly to a grinding roar. Where his foot struck, a crevice opened in the solid rock that widened instantly. Then, with a deafening crash, a whole section of the ledge gave way. There was a last glimpse of Khemsa, with arms wildly upflung, and then he vanished amidst the roar of the avalanche that thundered down into the abyss.

The four looked contemplatively at the ragged edge of rock that formed the new rim of the precipice, and then turned suddenly. Conan, thrown off his feet by the shudder of the mountain, was rising, lifting Yasmina. He seemed to move as slowly as his brain was working. He was befogged and stupid. He realized that there was a desperate need for him to lift the Devi on the black stallion and ride like the wind, but an unaccountable sluggishness weighted his every thought and action.

And now the wizards had turned toward him; they raised their arms, and to his horrified sight, he saw their outlines fading, dimming, becoming hazy and nebulous, as a crimson smoke billowed around their feet and rose about them. They were blotted out by a sudden whirling cloud--and then he realized that he too was enveloped in a blinding crimson mist--he heard Yasmina scream, and the stallion cried out like a woman in pain. The Devi was torn from his arm, and as he lashed out with his knife blindly, a terrific blow like a gust of storm wind knocked him sprawling against a rock. Dazedly he saw a crimson conoid cloud spinning up and over the mountain slopes. Yasmina was gone, and so were the four men in black. Only the terrified stallion shared the ledge with him.

!!!

_*CONAN*_
What in—

A low rumble cut him short. The stallion snorted and shied. From beyond a crag a man staggered into view. He reeled toward them, hands outstretched. His face was bloodless, his eyes pools of glassy blackness.

_*YASMINA*_
Khemsa!

_*CONAN*_
Who?

She wrenched herself from Conan’s arm and sprang from the saddle before he could catch her wrist.

_*YASMINA*_
Khemsa! Gitara—where is Gitara?

The man halted uncertainly, as if her voice tugged at invisible strings. His lips moved stiffly.

_*KHEMSA*_
Yas… mina…

_*YASMINA*_
Khemsa—what has happened? Where is she?

The sorcerer lifted one trembling arm. His voice was thick, dragged upward as if against tremendous weight.

_*KHEMSA*_
They… have taken her… the Masters… the… Black… Seers…

He lurched forward. Conan sprang from the saddle just in time to catch the falling body. The Cimmerian swore.

_*CONAN*_
He’s dying!

The man’s fingers clawed blindly; his breath came in short, bubbling gasps.

_*KHEMSA*_
Yasmina… forgive… I could not… resist… they drew me… they drew us both… like a magnet… Gitara… crying… calling…

_*YASMINA*_
Where is she now? Where have they taken her?

_*KHEMSA*_
To—to—the peak… to the Tower… to Yimsha…

The last word dissolved in a shuddering sigh. His body convulsed and went limp. Conan let him sink to the ground.

_*CONAN*_
Dead. He held on longer than most men would with a stab like that. Look—there’s no blood. Whatever struck him wasn’t a knife. Sorcery.

Yasmina knelt beside the still form, trembling violently.

_*YASMINA*_
Gitara… oh, Gitara…

Conan caught her by the arm and pulled her to her feet just as a thin, high laugh floated across the crags.

_*YASMINA*_
What was that?

_*CONAN*_
Witchcraft! Back to the horse!

He swept her up bodily and leaped into the saddle. The stallion reared, screaming, as a line of shapes glided out onto a ledge high above them.

Four tall figures stood motionless against the sky—clad in robes of absolute black, their faces masked, their bodies unearthly still.

_*YASMINA*_
The Black Seers!

_*CONAN*_
Aye—may Mitra blast their souls!

One lifted a long, thin arm. Something shimmered in the air—like a ripple of water across glass. Conan spurred the stallion violently, and the ripple struck the rock where they had been, splintering stone into a fine white mist.

The horse thundered down the trail. Behind them the Seers stood silent, like shadows cut of night.

_*YASMINA*_
They killed Khemsa—they have Gitara—they will come for me—

_*CONAN*_
Let them come! They’ll find they’ve trapped a panther, not a rabbit!

But the bravado could not mask the tension in his powerful frame. His eyes searched the cliffs restlessly.

They plunged into a narrow defile. Loose shale cascaded beneath the stallion’s hooves. The sky narrowed overhead to a ribbon of cold blue. Wind moaned between the walls like a trapped spirit.

Yasmina clung to him, shivering violently—less from the cold than from the vast, oppressive silence behind them.

Then Conan spoke abruptly.

_*CONAN*_
There’s a cave mouth ahead. We’ll have shelter for a moment. Those devils won’t strike again until they can see us clearly.

He reined into the shallow cavern. The shadow swallowed them.

_*YASMINA*_
Conan… will they follow?

_*CONAN*_
They will. Wizards always finish what they start. But first I must know why they want you. Khemsa said nothing of that.

_*YASMINA*_
They murdered my brother—the King. They plotted with Kerim Shah. And they fear me alive, for I know too much. They would have slain me long ago save that their power does not reach beyond these hills without a human hand to wield it.

_*CONAN*_
And that hand was Khemsa’s—until he broke free.

_*YASMINA*_
Yes. When he loved Gitara, he defied them. They cannot forgive that.

_*CONAN*_
Hmph. Wizards deal harshly with deserters.

He turned toward the cave mouth, scanning the crags.

_*CONAN*_
We can’t stay. If they’re moving in the air like that red cloud we saw, they’ll be above us already.

He swung into the saddle again.

_*CONAN*_
Hold fast. We ride for Afghulistan—there I have men who owe me blood and steel. With a dozen Afghuli blades at my back, I’ll climb Yimsha itself or tear the Tower down stone by stone.

Yasmina looked up at him, eyes wide with mingled fear and hope.

_*YASMINA*_
Then—you will help me?

_*CONAN*_
Aye. And not only because you’re a queen. You’re flesh and blood—and you’re *mine* to protect while you ride with me.

She seemed about to speak, but a thunderous boom echoed through the mountains, drowning her words. A crimson flash swept across the sky like a falling star.

_*YASMINA*_
The Carpet! Yimsha’s Carpet again!

_*CONAN*_
They’re hunting. And we’re the game. Ride!

The stallion plunged out of the cavern and down the twisting path as the mountains trembled with distant, sorcerous thunder.

!!!

The trail twisted like a wounded serpent between walls of naked granite. The stallion’s hooves struck sparks from the stone as Conan urged him along at a reckless pace. The thunder behind them grew louder, more insistent — not the voice of storm or avalanche, but something stranger, deeper, as if the mountains themselves muttered in sorcerous discontent.

_*YASMINA*_
Conan—look!

A crimson glare flickered across the sky above the cliffs. Again the weird cloud—no longer a drifting feather, but a streak of glowing fire — flashed overhead like a living comet.

_*CONAN*_
They’ve loosed their deviltry again! Bend low, girl!

He forced her head down against his shoulder as the red streak swooped. A blast of icy wind struck them, lifting grit and loose pebbles from the path. The stallion screamed and nearly reared, but Conan’s iron grip kept him steady.

The crimson streak whirled upward again, then hovered like a malignant star over the narrow ravine.

_*YASMINA*_
What is it?

_*CONAN*_
A thing of wizardry. Maybe it’s the Seers’ eyes. Maybe it’s something worse. Whatever it is, it hunts us.

The path widened briefly as they burst out onto a ledge overlooking a sheer abyss. The stallion, lathered and trembling, slowed of his own accord. Conan scanned the heights warily.

_*CONAN*_
They’re driving us west whether we will or not — toward Afghulistan. I don’t like being herded, even by devils.

He swung down from the saddle, lifting Yasmina with him. The wind whipped her borrowed garments against her limbs.

_*YASMINA*_
Why do we stop?

_*CONAN*_
To see what our hunters mean to do next. A man — even a wizard — makes mistakes when he thinks he has his quarry cornered.

He strode to the lip of the cliff and peered downward. The drop plunged a thousand feet to a tangle of crags and drifting blue mists.

Then the booming voice of the mountains rolled again — closer this time, vibrating through the very rock.

The crimson streak descended.

It spiraled downward until it hovered no more than bowshot above the ledge. Yasmina cried out and shrank against Conan. The Cimmerian drew his great sword in a single sweep; the blade glittered like lightning in the eerie red glow.

_*YASMINA*_
Can steel fight it?

_*CONAN*_
I’ve split ghosts before. If it bleeds or breaks — I’ll kill it.

The streak shuddered — then abruptly burst apart like a crimson bubble. A shower of sparkling red motes rained down, dissolving before they touched the ground. The booming ceased. Silence returned, unnaturally deep.

Conan lowered his sword, scowling.

_*CONAN*_
A warning. They’re telling us they can strike when they choose.

_*YASMINA*_
Then why do they not kill us now?

_*CONAN*_
Because they *want* you alive. Sorcerers always have a reason. When I know that reason, I’ll know how to kill them.

He sheathed his sword and caught the stallion’s reins.

_*CONAN*_
We ride again. If the devils want to drive us toward my own people, let them. They may find Afghuli steel less easy to bend than wizard-fire.

They mounted and pressed on. The ravine broadened into a long stony shelf that wound upward in a relentless climb. On either side rose walls of naked rock — immense, ancient, silent.

The sun dipped lower. Shadows lengthened, filling the fissures and gullies with purple gloom.

Then, faint and distant, from far ahead, came a new sound — the deep, wolfish baying of men’s voices.

Yasmina stiffened.

_*YASMINA*_
What is that?

_*CONAN*_
War-cries. Afghulis — or one of the border tribes.

He listened, then nodded grimly.

_*CONAN*_
Aye. Afghulis. My people. But something’s wrong. Those are the cries of men in battle.

He spurred the stallion into a swifter pace. The cries grew louder — a tumult of savage voices, the clash of steel, the harsh shrieks of wounded men.

As they rounded a jutting fang of rock, the full scene burst into view.

A wide ledge stretched before them, sloping gently downward. On it two tribes were locked in combat: a knot of Afghuli warriors fighting furiously against a larger force of Wazulis. Dust and blood stained the ground. Arrows clattered off rocks. Steel flashed in the sinking light.

_*YASMINA*_
The Wazulis! They have come for vengeance — for Yar Afzal!

_*CONAN*_
And they’ve caught my men unprepared. Hold tight!

He drove the stallion straight into the melee.

Several Wazulis turned, yelling in alarm as the huge horse bore down on them like a thunderbolt. Conan rose in the saddle, his sword a streak of burning silver.

He cut one man down with a single blow; the fellow fell without a sound. Another leaped aside, and Conan’s horse trampled a third flat into the dust.

The Afghulis rallied at once.

_*AFGHULI WARRIORS*_
Conan! Conan! The Cimmerian chief!

The Wazulis faltered. Several turned to flee.

_*CONAN*_
After them! Drive them off the ledge!

The Afghulis surged forward with renewed fury. In moments the Wazulis broke ranks entirely and fled toward the narrow trail at the far end of the ledge.

Conan swung down from the saddle, pulling Yasmina with him. The Afghulis crowded around him, panting and blood-streaked.

_*AFGHULI CAPTAIN*_
Chief, we thought you slain! Word came that Yar Afzal had taken your head!

_*CONAN*_
My head’s still on my shoulders. What’s this fight?

_*AFGHULI CAPTAIN*_
The Wazulis came shrieking out of the hills like madmen, crying that a demon-voice had commanded them to kill your tribe to the last babe!

_*CONAN*_
A demon-voice—

He glanced upward toward the shadowed peaks.

_*CONAN*_
—aye. The same voice that urged them to kill *me*.

He turned back to the men.

_*CONAN*_
Enough talk. Muster the warriors. We ride to the village. There’s worse than Wazulis loose in these mountains.

As the warriors hurried to obey, Yasmina touched Conan’s arm.

_*YASMINA*_
You mean to fight the Black Seers?

_*CONAN*_
If they cross my path — aye. And I mean to go to Yimsha itself. For your sake — and for my own.

Yasmina’s eyes widened, but she did not speak. The wind swept across the ledge, carrying with it the distant murmur of the mountain — a low rumble, as if something vast and ancient stirred in the depths of Yimsha.

The shadows grew longer still.

!!! 4

The Afghulis gathered swiftly — tall, hawk-faced men in worn mail-shirts, wearing plumes and beads in their black hair, their curved tulwars stained with fresh blood. They crowded around Conan, firing questions, cursing the Wazulis, glaring suspiciously at Yasmina until Conan silenced them with a gesture.

_*CONAN*_
This woman is under my protection. Speak one word against her and I’ll break your jaw. Now — how many men can we muster?

_*AFGHULI CAPTAIN*_
Thirty here, Chief. Another twenty hunting in the western gorges. But what foe are we marching against? The Wazulis are broken for now.

Conan glanced toward the towering peak of Yimsha, veiled in gathering dusk.

_*CONAN*_
Not men — wizards. Devils in human shape. The Black Seers of Yimsha.

A murmur ran through the tribesmen — unease mixed with fear.

_*AFGHULI WARRIOR*_
Chief… men do not war with the sorcerers of the Tower. No tribe will go near Yimsha!

_*CONAN*_
Afghulis will. Or I’ll know why. Those devils took a girl — Gitara. They slew a man with witchcraft. And they hunt this woman. They’ve meddled in the affairs of my tribe. So now it’s blood for blood.

He stepped into their midst, iron in his voice.

_*CONAN*_
Which of you calls yourself a warrior, yet quails before a shadow on a mountain?

There was silence — then a few harsh laughs.

_*AFGHULI CAPTAIN*_
We go where you lead, Conan. But how do flesh and steel prevail against wizardry?

_*CONAN*_
Steel bites sorcerer’s flesh as deep as any other — if you strike before he mutters his devil’s spells. And I’ve seen wizards die. Their magic isn’t armor.

He pointed toward the winding trail.

_*CONAN*_
We march now. Before the night grows old. Wizards are strongest when the moon is high.

The Afghulis nodded grimly. Torches were lit; gear was collected; arrows were checked. Conan lifted Yasmina onto the stallion once more and swung up behind her.

As they began the ascent, the Afghulis formed a loose column, shadows dancing around them in the flickering torchlight.

---

They traveled for an hour through twisting defiles. The sky darkened to deep indigo. Stars flared like cold needles. The wind sharpened, carrying the scent of snow and stone.

Yasmina shivered.

_*YASMINA*_
Conan… they fear this place.

_*CONAN*_
Aye. But they fear me more.

He said it without pride — only truth.

Suddenly a piercing cry echoed from the cliffs above — not human, not animal, but something in-between: a shriek of malice that froze the blood.

The Afghulis halted, hands on their hilts.

_*AFGHULI WARRIOR*_
By the teeth of the devil — what was that?

_*CONAN*_
Trouble.

He scanned the heights. Yasmina clutched his arm.

_*YASMINA*_
Look — there!

A dark shape detached itself from a rock shelf overhead. It dropped silently — then spread vast, batlike wings that blotted the stars. The creature swooped low across the column, its eyes glowing like green coals.

The horses reared and screamed. A warrior was snatched from his saddle, carried shrieking into the air.

_*AFGHULI WARRIOR*_
The winged fiend! Yimsha’s demon!

Arrows flew wildly but struck nothing; the creature had vanished into the cliffs.

_*CONAN*_
Keep moving! That thing won’t strike twice in the same breath — sorcerous beasts never do.

But even he looked grim as they advanced.

The trail climbed higher, winding like a serpent through the broken crags. Frost glittered on the stones though the night was young. Torches sputtered in the rising wind.

At last the column reached a broad shelf where the path divided.

Conan raised a hand.

_*CONAN*_
We rest here. Only for a moment.

The warriors sank to the ground, muttering uneasily. Yasmina gazed at Conan, seeing the lines of thought etched across his rugged features.

_*YASMINA*_
What troubles you?

_*CONAN*_
We’re being herded — as I feared. There’s only one trail toward Yimsha from here, and something’s driving us onto it. A beast in the air, a voice in the Wazulis’ heads, that crimson cloud — all pushing us west, always west.

_*YASMINA*_
Toward the Tower.

_*CONAN*_
Aye.

He frowned into the darkness.

_*CONAN*_
If they wanted us dead, we’d be dead. So they want us alive. That’s what bothers me.

An Afghuli scout scrambled up the rocks toward them, panting.

_*AFGHULI SCOUT*_
Chief! I climbed the rise to look ahead. There’s a fire on the trail — but not a campfire. It glows white as a star, and it hangs above the ground!

A chill ran through the warriors.

_*AFGHULI CAPTAIN*_
A ghost-fire… a snare of wizardry…

Conan rose.

_*CONAN*_
Show me.

He strode to the edge of the shelf. Below, on a lower trail, hung a globe of pale white flame — about the height of a man, floating motionless, humming faintly.

Yasmina gasped.

_*YASMINA*_
A spirit-light…

_*CONAN*_
No spirit. A lure.

He watched the thing for a long moment.

Then — abruptly — it began to drift toward them.

_*YASMINA*_
Conan!

_*CONAN*_
Back! All of you!

He shoved Yasmina behind him as he drew his sword.

The white globe drifted closer — humming softly, hypnotically — bathing the rocks in ghostly silver. Afghuli warriors staggered, slack-jawed, entranced.

Conan snarled.

_*CONAN*_
Devil’s bait!

He sprang forward and slashed at the thing with all his might.

Steel met sorcery.

The globe burst with a sound like cracking ice — shards of cold white fire exploded outward. Warriors cried out. The ledge trembled.

When the glare faded, the globe was gone.

But Conan stood swaying slightly, his sword rimed with frost.

_*YASMINA*_
Conan! Are you harmed?

_*CONAN*_
No… but they know we’re coming.

He wiped the blade clean and sheathed it.

_*CONAN*_
Mount up. We make for the Tower — now. Before dawn. Before they conjure worse.

The Afghulis, shaken but resolute, obeyed.

Together they pressed on into the night — toward Yimsha and the doom awaiting them there.

!!! 5

The path grew narrower as they climbed, hugging the side of cliffs that plunged into darkness. The moon rose — a thin, cold crescent that shed little light. Torches flickered and guttered in the rising wind.

The Afghulis rode in grim silence. Even their usual boasts and curses were absent. Fear hung over them like a shroud.

Suddenly the trail bent sharply around a jutting crag — and narrowed to scarcely the width of a horse’s shoulders.

_*AFGHULI CAPTAIN*_
By the Prophet’s beard… this wasn’t so narrow when last we used it.

_*CONAN*_
The rocks move here. Wizards’ tricks. Keep to the wall — and no man look down.

Even Conan spoke softly. The drop on the outer side was bottomless darkness.

Yasmina felt the stallion tremble beneath her.

_*YASMINA*_
Conan… is the mountain alive?

_*CONAN*_
No — but something in it is waking.

They advanced single-file, the horses stepping with agonizing care. Loose stones skittered off the edge and vanished without a sound.

Then — faint but distinct — came a low *chanting* from somewhere above.

The Afghulis froze.

_*AFGHULI WARRIOR*_
The Seers! They chant death!

_*CONAN*_
Ride! The one place you don’t want to be when sorcerers sing is beneath them.

They urged the horses forward — but a sudden tremor quivered through the trail. Dust sifted from the cliff overhead.

Then a slab of rock, as large as a hut, detached itself and plunged down upon them.

_*YASMINA*_
Conan!

_*CONAN*_
Hold tight!

Conan kicked the stallion hard. The great steed lunged ahead, hooves striking sparks on the stone. Behind them the boulder smashed onto the trail, shattering it — and hurling two Afghulis screaming into the abyss.

The survivors spurred forward desperately.

At last they reached wider ground — a high saddle between two peaks. The wind shrieked across it, cold as a blade.

The Afghulis dismounted, shaken.

_*AFGHULI CAPTAIN*_
Chief… we’ve lost men. Two into the gorge, one crushed by the falling rock… and others vanish in the dark behind.

_*CONAN*_
Wizards don’t fight fair. Remember that. Now—look there.

He pointed across the saddle.

Beyond the pass, the land sloped down into a strange hollow — a valley cupped between three bare peaks. At its center rose a tower of black stone, narrow and impossibly tall, tapering like a spear thrust into the sky. No windows were visible; no doors; no lights.

A cold radiance hung over the valley — not moonlight, not torches — an eerie pallor that made the black tower stand out like a blot of night.

_*YASMINA*_
The Tower of the Seers…

Her voice trembled.

_*CONAN*_
Aye. And no guards, no walls, no outposts. They don’t need them. Their magic is guard enough.

He turned to the warriors.

_*CONAN*_
We go in on foot now. Leave the horses. They’d bolt before we reached the valley floor.

The Afghulis obeyed reluctantly.

As they descended the slope, the air grew unnaturally still. No wind stirred. No insects chirped. Even the sound of their footsteps seemed muffled.

Yasmina moved closer to Conan.

_*YASMINA*_
The silence… it crushes me.

_*CONAN*_
That’s wizard-work. They want fear to gnaw at you before they strike.

Halfway down the slope, a warrior cried out hoarsely.

_*AFGHULI WARRIOR*_
Chief! Look — look!

He pointed to the far side of the valley.

There, standing motionless upon a ridge, was the figure of a woman — slim, graceful — robes fluttering slightly though there was no wind.

Her face was pale, luminous.

Her hair fell like a dark river.

_*YASMINA*_
Gitara!

She tried to run toward the apparition, but Conan caught her arm.

_*CONAN*_
No! That’s not her.

_*YASMINA*_
But—her shape—the way she stands—

_*CONAN*_
It’s a lure. A shadow made to break your wits. Look — it has no feet upon the ground.

Indeed, the figure hovered a hand’s breadth above the ridge.

Yasmina shuddered violently.

The apparition raised one arm and beckoned — slow, graceful, irresistible.

Several Afghulis swayed, entranced.

Conan roared like a lion.

_*CONAN*_
Stand fast, you fools!

He seized a handful of gravel and hurled it toward the image.

The stones passed through the woman as though through smoke.

The illusion dissolved — scattering like mist.

But instantly, in its place, four tall, black-robed figures appeared — the **Seers of Yimsha** themselves.

They stood in a row, motionless as carved idols. Their robes were darker than shadow; their faces hidden behind veils of midnight silk. Each carried a long staff of black wood.

The Afghulis muttered prayers.

_*YASMINA*_
The Black Seers…

_*CONAN*_
Aye. And not illusions this time.

One Seer raised his staff.

The ground beneath the Afghulis writhed — as if snakes coiled under the soil. Several warriors stumbled. One fell with a cry as the earth swallowed his legs to the knee.

_*AFGHULI WARRIOR*_
The ground pulls us down! It’s alive!

_*CONAN*_
Move! Keep to the rocks!

He dragged Yasmina onto a slab of stone just as the soil around them churned like a river of worms.

The Seer’s staff lowered.

The earth grew still.

Then another Seer extended his arm.

From the black sleeve blossomed a cloud of blue vapor — drifting toward the Afghulis with silent malice.

_*YASMINA*_
What is that?

_*CONAN*_
Death.

He tore a cloak from a warrior’s shoulders and threw it over Yasmina.

_*CONAN*_
Cover your mouth! Don’t breathe it!

The vapor touched an Afghuli at the edge of the group.

He screamed once — then shriveled, skin tightening over bone, collapsing as if a lifetime drained from him in a heartbeat.

The warriors recoiled in horror.

Conan snarled.

_*CONAN*_
Stay together! Follow me — and don’t look back!

He lifted Yasmina into his arms and plunged toward a line of boulders that shielded them from the drifting cloud.

Behind them, the Seers advanced with slow, nightmare grace.

Their voices rose in a dreadful chant — a sound like wind moaning through the bones of the dead.

Yasmina clung to Conan.

_*YASMINA*_
Conan… can we reach the Tower alive?

_*CONAN*_
If the gods want us dead, they’ll have to try harder.

!!! 6

Conan vaulted over a low ridge of stone, landing lightly despite Yasmina in his arms. The Afghulis scrambled after him, gasping, stumbling, cursing the Seers with hoarse desperation.

Behind them, the Black Seers glided forward, their dark forms seeming not to walk but *drift* across the earth. The blue vapor curled at their feet like a living thing, hungry for more flesh.

_*CONAN*_
Keep to the high rocks! Follow me — don’t scatter!

But fear gnawed at the Afghulis. Several bolted up different slopes, panic overtaking sense.

A Seer raised his staff.

The fleeing warriors stiffened mid-stride — then toppled silently, lifeless as cut grass.

Yasmina buried her face against Conan’s shoulder.

_*YASMINA*_
They slay with a gesture… as easily as breathing…

_*CONAN*_
Aye — but they’re not gods. Remember that.

He lowered her onto her feet behind a tall boulder.

_*CONAN*_
Stay low. Don’t step into the open unless I drag you.

She nodded, trembling.

Conan turned to the Afghulis who had managed to stay with him — fewer now, hard-eyed and grim.

_*CONAN*_
Listen, you wolves! Steel won’t win this unless we get close enough to use it. Those devils need sight for their spells. Blind their view — break their rhythm — rush them while they weave their next curse!

_*AFGHULI CAPTAIN*_
Chief, we are with you! Lead, and we follow to death or victory!

Conan’s teeth flashed.

_*CONAN*_
Good. We may find both before sunrise.

---

They advanced between jagged rocks, keeping low. The Seers shifted their alignment, drifting to block the approach to the Tower. Their unity was unnatural — moving with one mind, as though threads of sorcery bound them together.

The valley floor spread before them like a dark basin. At its center loomed the Tower — black, smooth, without seam or crack, rising impossibly tall into the starless sky.

A faint red glow pulsed at its summit, throbbing like a heartbeat.

_*YASMINA*_
Conan… something watches us from the top…

_*CONAN*_
Then let it watch. It’ll get a show soon enough.

He motioned for the warriors to circle along the right flank.

As they did, a sudden shriek tore through the air.

Yasmina whirled.

From the shadows behind them swooped the bat-winged creature that had carried off the Afghuli earlier. Its eyes gleamed green fire; its talons shone like polished steel.

_*AFGHULI WARRIOR*_
The winged devil returns!

The beast plunged into their midst.

Conan surged forward, both hands gripping his sword.

_*CONAN*_
This one bleeds, I swear it!

He swung upward. The gigantic blade met leathery wing with a sound like tearing cloth — and black ichor sprayed the rocks.

The creature screamed, a hideous, unearthly sound.

It beat its wings desperately, but Conan struck again — cleaving a talon from its limb. The beast staggered into the air and fled, howling into the peaks.

The Afghulis roared in triumph.

_*AFGHULI WARRIOR*_
A sign! Chief, a sign! Sorcery can be slain!

Conan spat on the ground.

_*CONAN*_
Enough cheering. The Seers saw that. They won’t attack with beasts again — they’ll strike with something worse.

He pointed with his sword toward the Tower.

_*CONAN*_
We have moments — not minutes — before their next curse. Move!

---

They descended toward the valley floor. The strange pale glow intensified, outlining the Tower in stark relief. The air felt heavy, electric, as if a storm were building without wind.

Then — abruptly — the Seers halted.

They raised their staffs in unison.

_*YASMINA*_
Conan—run!

_*CONAN*_
Hold!

A shudder ran through the ground. Cracks lanced outward like black lightning. The earth split open, revealing gaping fissures.

From these fissures crawled *things* — twisted shapes formed of shadow and stone, like half-born creatures sculpted from nightmare. They clawed their way into the moonlight, eyeless faces turning toward the Afghulis.

_*AFGHULI CAPTAIN*_
By Allah — earth-demons!

_*CONAN*_
Kill them! They’re solid enough!

A demon lunged at Conan. He met it with an overhead stroke. The blade sheared through stone-flesh; the creature split in two, dissolving into black dust.

The Afghulis rallied, hacking at the monstrosities with renewed ferocity.

But for every demon slain, two more crawled forth.

Yasmina cried out as one dragged itself toward her. Conan spun, seized a fallen spear, and hurled it. The shaft pierced the creature’s torso; it burst apart in a shower of grit.

_*CONAN*_
Stay behind me!

She obeyed.

The air trembled.

The Seers lowered their staffs.

The demons ceased emerging.

The fissures closed like wounds.

But now a new threat appeared.

---

A ring of green fire bloomed around the Tower — a perfect circle, bright as emeralds, rising from the earth like a wall of living flame.

It hissed, shimmering with unearthly heat.

_*YASMINA*_
A barrier… we cannot pass!

_*CONAN*_
Oh, we’ll pass. Every wall has a weakness — even a wizard’s toy.

He stalked forward, wiping sweat from his brow. The heat was fierce, stinging the air around them.

The Afghulis hesitated.

_*AFGHULI CAPTAIN*_
Chief… that fire is not natural. It may burn flesh from bone.

_*CONAN*_
Then stay back and pray. I’m done with illusions and ghost-lights.

He gripped his sword and stepped closer to the green fire.

The heat intensified — but the flames did not flicker. They burned with unnatural steadiness.

Conan narrowed his eyes.

_*CONAN*_
Not fire… a barrier of will. Break the will, break the wall.

He raised his sword — and thrust it forward.

The blade touched the green fire.

And stopped.

The air boomed like a great drum. The barrier flared.

Yasmina cried out as Conan staggered backward, sparks dancing along the sword’s edge.

But he recovered at once.

_*CONAN*_
It weakens when they shift their focus — when they weave a spell.

He turned back to the Afghulis.

_*CONAN*_
When they chant next, rush behind me. I’ll break the barrier when their minds turn.

_*YASMINA*_
Conan… you risk everything.

_*CONAN*_
Woman, everything worth doing is a risk.

He looked toward the Seers.

_*CONAN*_
All right, you black-robed carrion… show me your next trick.

The Seers spread apart — evenly spaced around the valley rim.

Their arms rose.

Their veiled faces tilted toward the sky.

The chant began.

Low at first — barely a murmur — then rising.

And rising.

The green fire flickered.

_*CONAN (shouting)*_
Now!

!!! 7

At Conan’s shout, the Afghulis surged forward like wolves, their sandals striking sparks on the stone. Conan raised his sword and hurled himself at the shimmering green wall.

The barrier flickered violently as the Seers’ chant rose in pitch.

_*CONAN*_
Again!

He swung with all the force in his mighty shoulders. The blade struck the barrier — and this time, instead of rebounding, it sank a hand’s breadth into the green flame.

The valley shook.

The barrier shuddered, warping like heated glass.

_*AFGHULI CAPTAIN*_
It weakens! Press, men — press!

Conan roared like a maddened bull and drove his weight into the sword. The green flame split, a jagged fissure forming around the blade.

The Seers’ chant faltered.

The flame surged back — but the rhythm was broken.

A second blow, delivered with a bellow of defiance, shattered the fissure into a widening breach.

_*CONAN*_
Through! Move!

The Afghulis poured into the gap. The instant the last man crossed, Conan jerked his blade free and dove after them.

Behind him, the barrier snapped shut with a sound like thunder.

The warriors gasped, staring back at the now-solid ring of green fire that imprisoned them inside.

_*AFGHULI WARRIOR*_
We are trapped within! There is no turning back!

_*CONAN*_
Good. I didn’t plan to leave by the way we came.

He pointed toward the base of the Tower, looming ahead like a monolith of pure night.

_*CONAN*_
There’s the door — if such devils have need of one.

They advanced cautiously. The ground within the barrier was unnaturally smooth, as if polished by centuries of sorcery. No vegetation grew; no sound echoed except their own breaths.

At last they reached the Tower’s foot.

The surface was seamless — cold as iron and darker than shadow. It reflected no light.

_*YASMINA*_
There is no entrance.

_*CONAN*_
There’ll be one. Wizards need doors same as men — unless they fly through cracks like smoke.

He circled the base, running a calloused hand along the stone.

Suddenly his fingers stopped.

A faint outline — a tall, narrow arch — trembled into view as if emerging from behind an invisible veil.

_*CONAN*_
There!

The warriors gathered round.

The outline deepened, the surface rippling like water — then solidified into a doorway barred by nothing but darkness itself.

Conan stepped forward.

_*AFGHULI CAPTAIN*_
Chief — wait! A trap!

_*CONAN*_
Every step in this cursed valley is a trap. Stay behind me.

He entered the doorway.

---

Inside was a corridor of stone so black it drank the torchlight. Their flames seemed to cower, shrinking to feeble glows. The air was cold — not natural cold, but the chill of deep caverns and forgotten tombs.

The Afghulis followed reluctantly.

Yasmina stayed close at Conan’s side.

A faint hum rose in the darkness — a vibration more felt than heard.

_*YASMINA*_
My skin… tingles.

_*CONAN*_
Magic. Old and strong.

They moved deeper.

Suddenly the corridor widened into a chamber — circular, vast, and vacant.

The ceiling soared beyond sight. In the center of the floor lay a great stone disk carved with symbols that writhed faintly, shifting when unobserved.

The Afghulis murmured nervously.

_*AFGHULI WARRIOR*_
Those runes… they live.

_*CONAN*_
Forget the floor. Look there.

He pointed upward.

On a balcony high above them, four figures stood: the **Black Seers** — silent, unmoving, staffs in hand.

Yasmina gasped.

_*YASMINA*_
They watch us like vultures…

_*CONAN*_
Aye. But vultures don’t strike until the beast is down. These devils mean to strike now.

The Seers lifted their staffs.

The chamber darkened further. Shadows gathered in the corners, creeping inward like living ink.

One Seer spoke — his voice soft, cold, and hollow.

_*FIRST SEER*_
Cimmerian… you come to your death.

Conan spat.

_*CONAN*_
You’ll find it a hard job to kill me from up there. Come down and try steel instead of shadows.

A low, humorless hiss passed among the Seers.

_*SECOND SEER*_
Steel is for beasts of the earth. We are beyond such weapons.

_*CONAN*_
We’ll see.

The Seers’ staffs glowed.

Shadows surged.

From the walls leapt forms of darkness — half-shaped beings, tall as men yet without features, their limbs flowing like tar.

The Afghulis cried out.

_*AFGHULI CAPTAIN*_
More demons!

_*CONAN*_
Cut them down! They bleed shadow, but they fall like anything else if you strike hard!

He met the first shadow-beast with a bellow, cleaving it clean through. It dissolved into black vapor.

Another sprang at him. He crushed it with a backswing.

But more poured in.

The chamber erupted into chaos — swords flashing, shadows writhing, Afghulis screaming war-cries as they hacked desperately.

Yasmina pressed against a pillar, shielding her face.

_*YASMINA*_
Conan! There are too many—

_*CONAN (shouting)*_
Then stay behind me!

He fought like a storm given flesh — each blow smashing a creature of darkness into fragments.

Still, the Seers’ chanting grew louder, weaving around the battle like a net of sound.

Conan felt the weight of it pressing on his mind — a cold pressure like a hand gripping his skull.

The First Seer lifted his staff.

_*FIRST SEER*_
Sleep, barbarian. Sleep forever.

Conan staggered.

Yasmina cried out.

_*YASMINA*_
Conan!

He shook his head violently, muscles bulging as he fought the spell.

_*CONAN*_
I… don’t… sleep!

With a roar he hurled his sword like a spear.

The blade spun end over end, flashing through the darkness — and struck the balcony rail with a ringing crack. The First Seer recoiled, his staff wavering.

The chant faltered.

The shadow-creatures stumbled.

Conan charged toward the pillar beneath the balcony.

_*CONAN*_
I’m coming for you devils — one by one!

He leapt for the rock — beginning the climb toward the balcony where the Seers waited.

!!! 8

Conan's fingers found purchase on the cold stone. He heaved himself upward with the ferocity of a hunting cat. Below, the remaining Afghulis battled the fading shadow-creatures, but their strength was failing.

The Seers’ chant resumed — louder, faster now — a rising storm of syllables that pressed upon the air like an oppressive weight.

_*YASMINA*_
Conan! They see you — they aim their magic at you!

_*CONAN (growling)*_
Let them!

He pulled himself onto a narrow ledge halfway up the pillar. The First Seer extended a hand toward him.

_*FIRST SEER*_
Fall, Cimmerian.

The stone beneath Conan’s feet turned slick as oil. His boots skidded. He nearly plunged into the abyss below.

With a roar of defiance, he slammed one fist into the rock, gripping a jagged ridge and steadying himself.

_*CONAN*_
You’ll have to do better than that!

He launched upward again.

The Second Seer stepped forward.

_*SECOND SEER*_
Blindness be upon your eyes!

A surge of black energy flashed toward Conan. He jerked his head aside — but the edge of the blast grazed him. Darkness clouded his vision, swirling like ink poured over his eyes.

Yasmina screamed below.

_*YASMINA*_
Conan! Conan!

He snarled, shaking his head violently.

_*CONAN*_
No wizard robs me of sight!

With sheer will and raw fury, he forced the darkness back. Shapes returned — blurred at first, then sharpening.

The Seers hissed in frustrated unison.

The Third stepped forward.

_*THIRD SEER*_
You climb toward death. We have slain whole armies with a word.

_*CONAN*_
Aye? Then save breath — you’ll need it soon.

He lunged up the final stretch.

---

Below, calamity struck.

A wave of invisible force washed across the chamber. Afghuli warriors were hurled from their feet, dashed against walls, slammed to the ground. Many did not rise.

The captain staggered toward Yasmina.

_*AFGHULI CAPTAIN*_
Princess… this is wizard-war… our blades… our strength… nothing stands…

He collapsed at her feet.

Only a handful of Afghulis remained upright, bloodied and gasping.

Yasmina looked up helplessly at Conan, climbing alone toward the four masters of Yimsha.

---

Conan reached the balcony.

With a final surge he vaulted over the black railing — landing in a crouch.

The Seers recoiled slightly, though they did not retreat.

They regarded him with cold, expressionless contempt.

_*FIRST SEER*_
You are strong. But strength is nothing in the House of Yimsha.

_*CONAN (breathing hard)*_
Strength has brought me farther than any man who ever crossed your cursed valley.

He advanced.

The First Seer thrust his staff toward Conan’s throat.

_*FIRST SEER*_
Kneel.

Conan slapped the staff aside with a sweep of his arm. Sparks burst from the impact. The Seer staggered.

_*CONAN*_
Bow to a wizard? I’d sooner bow to a donkey.

The Second Seer gestured. Chains of spectral fire erupted from the air, lashing toward Conan’s limbs. He ducked, rolled, and sprang forward, ripping one burning chain apart with his bare hands, scorched skin smoking.

The Third Seer raised both arms.

Lightning crackled from the ceiling, crashing down in a jagged bolt.

Conan twisted aside — the bolt struck the floor where he had stood, blasting black fragments into the air.

He rose with a snarl.

_*CONAN*_
I’ve had enough of this witch-dancing!

He rushed the Third Seer.

The sorcerer’s staff glowed with cold white fire — but Conan’s momentum was unstoppable. He crashed into the Seer with the force of a charging bull. The staff snapped; the Seer flew backward, smashing into the black stone pillars with a sickening crack.

The Seer slumped lifeless.

The remaining three hissed — an unearthly, collective cry.

_*SECOND SEER*_
You dare lay hands upon the Masters of Yimsha?

_*CONAN*_
Aye — and I’ll lay more before this is done.

They raised their staffs in unison.

Dark energy gathered, swirling into a vortex above the balcony. The air trembled. The stone floor vibrated.

Yasmina cried out from below.

_*YASMINA*_
Conan! They prepare a great spell — run!

_*CONAN (shouting back)*_
No running now!

He ripped a fallen spear from the hands of a dead Afghuli below the balcony — hurling it upward like a javelin.

The spear struck the First Seer in the chest.

The blow jarred him, breaking his stance. His staff flickered and dimmed. The vortex wavered.

Conan leaped forward.

He seized the railing — vaulted again — and landed directly before the faltering First Seer.

With one colossal blow of his fist, he drove the sorcerer to the floor. The Seer collapsed, veil torn, revealing a withered face drained of all humanity.

---

Two Seers remained.

They moved backward, realizing at last — too late — that their magic could not shield them from the brute force of a Cimmerian unleashed.

_*SECOND SEER (fearful)*_
Brother — together!

_*FOURTH SEER (coldly)*_
Aye. Let the Tower itself rise against him!

They lifted their staffs.

The entire chamber shook.

Cracks raced across the floor. The runes began to pulse — then erupted in pillars of green fire.

Below, the Afghulis fled for cover.

Yasmina was thrown from her feet. She slid toward one of the cracks — until Conan’s voice thundered above:

_*CONAN*_
Hold, girl! I’m coming!

He lunged toward the last two Seers — now chanting in desperate tandem, as the Tower itself groaned like a living thing.

The final confrontation loomed.


!!! 9

Conan charged the remaining Seers as the chamber trembled violently. Dust sifted from the vaulted ceiling; cracks zig-zagged through the walls like black lightning. The runes beneath his feet pulsed in maddened rhythm, glowing hot as molten emerald.

The last two Seers stood atop the balcony platform, robes billowing though no wind blew.

_*SECOND SEER*_
Hold him, Brother! Yimsha must not fall!

_*FOURTH SEER*_
The Tower stands on our breath — and shall not tremble before a barbarian!

They raised their staffs high.

A storm of force burst outward. Invisible hands hurled Conan backward. He slammed into the stone balustrade with bone-rattling impact. Yasmina, far below, cried out.

_*YASMINA*_
Conan! Get up!

Conan rose — slowly — shaking his head like a wounded lion. The air pressed around him like thickening mud. Each movement felt heavier.

The Seers advanced, chanting faster, their staffs pulsing with cold fire.

_*SECOND SEER*_
Kneel!

The force intensified.

Conan’s legs buckled.

He went down on one knee.

_*FOURTH SEER*_
Yield your will, barbarian. None defy the Masters of Yimsha and live.

Through clenched teeth, Conan growled:

_*CONAN*_
You’ve never met a Cimmerian.

With a roar that shook the platform, he forced himself upright against the crushing weight of sorcery. Veins bulged along his arms. His muscles knotted like iron cables.

The Seers faltered.

_*SECOND SEER (astonished)*_
Impossible… no mortal breaks the Binding Will…

_*CONAN*_
I’m no mortal you’ve known!

He flung himself forward.

The Second Seer thrust his staff downward. A torrent of white fire plunged toward Conan. The barbarian twisted aside; the blast scorched the stone floor into bubbling slag.

Before the sorcerer could strike again, Conan seized the staff in both hands.

The Seer shrieked.

_*SECOND SEER*_
Unhand me, beast!

_*CONAN*_
Gladly.

He swung the staff like a battering ram, smashing the Second Seer full in the chest. The sorcerer’s body flew backward, hitting a pillar with a sickening crunch.

The staff snapped in Conan’s hands.

The Second Seer dissolved — collapsing like a heap of ashes.

---

Only one Seer remained.

The Fourth, tallest and proudest of the order, stared down at Conan with unveiled hatred.

_*FOURTH SEER*_
Barbarian… you have slain the wisest minds of Yimsha. Your doom shall echo in the ages.

_*CONAN*_
Come down and try to make it so.

The last Seer descended from the platform — not walking, but *floating*, his black robes drifting like smoke around him.

The runes beneath him ignited, casting him in flickering green radiance.

He extended both hands.

The air tightened.

Yasmina clutched her throat below, gasping as the pressure mounted.

Afghuli survivors collapsed to their knees, choking.

Conan staggered — forced backward toward the balcony’s edge.

_*FOURTH SEER*_
Die without breath — your heart crushed like a withered fruit.

Conan’s vision darkened. Blood roared in his ears. His breath choked off in his throat.

But his eyes — fierce, unbroken — locked on the sorcerer.

_*CONAN (hoarsely)*_
You… should have… finished me… when I was below…

He lunged.

The Seer raised his hands — too late.

Conan barreled into him with the force of an avalanche.

Sorcery shattered.

The Seer’s concentration broke — the crushing pressure vanished. Air flooded Conan’s lungs.

He seized the Seer by the throat.

_*FOURTH SEER (strangled)*_
Unhand—me—barbarian—!

_*CONAN (bellowing)*_
Your wizardry can’t save your neck from my fingers!

He lifted the sorcerer bodily — a man who weighed no more than a bundle of sticks in his grasp.

The Seer clawed at Conan’s wrists, gasping. Green sparks spat from his hands, scorching Conan’s skin — but the Cimmerian did not loosen his grip.

With a final, terrible wrench, he broke the wizard’s spine.

The body fell limp.

Conan hurled it aside.

It struck the black floor — and instantly dissolved into a puddle of foul-smelling ooze.

---

Silence followed.

A deep, echoing silence that seemed to vibrate through the Tower.

The runes dimmed.

The green flame-circle outside guttered and died.

Shadows dissipated like morning fog.

Yasmina sank to her knees, trembling.

_*YASMINA*_
Conan… you have done the impossible.

He strode to the balcony rail and looked down at her.

_*CONAN*_
They weren’t gods. Just men with tricks. And tricks fail when a strong enough fist hits them.

The Tower groaned.

Cracks spread through the walls. Dust sifted from above.

The Afghulis stared upward in terror.

_*AFGHULI SURVIVOR*_
Chief — the Tower collapses!

_*CONAN*_
Then we get out.

He vaulted from the balcony, catching a tangle of carved stone and sliding down the pillar. He hit the floor running, scooped Yasmina up in his arms, and turned toward the entrance.

The chamber shook violently.

Chunks of the ceiling smashed to the ground.

A pillar toppled.

Conan sprinted across the collapsing hall.

Behind them the runes burst apart in fountains of green fire.

Yasmina cried out.

_*YASMINA*_
Conan — hurry! The mountain falls around us!

_*CONAN*_
Hold tight!

He dove through the archway just as the corridor behind them tore open like a splitting seam.

Stone thundered down.

The Tower of Yimsha — its power broken — began to die.

!!! 10

Conan burst from the collapsing corridor into the cold night air. Behind him, the Tower roared like a wounded titan. Yasmina clung to him, half-blinded by dust.

The Afghuli survivors staggered into the open, coughing, bloodied, wild-eyed.

A final cracking boom echoed as the uppermost pinnacle of the Tower lurched sideways.

_*AFGHULI SURVIVOR*_
Run! The mountain spits death!

They scrambled downhill, slipping on loose shale as the ground shuddered underfoot. A storm of debris blasted outward from the Tower’s base — shards of black stone flying like arrows.

Conan shielded Yasmina with his body as he raced toward the incline beyond the green-fire circle’s former boundary.

The Tower groaned a final time — a deep, corpse-like sigh.

Then it fell.

The vast spire collapsed inward, folding like wet parchment. A geyser of dust and rubble surged upward, swallowing the stars. Green fire flickered and died in the ruins.

Yasmina lifted her head from Conan’s shoulder.

_*YASMINA*_
It is… destroyed.

_*CONAN*_
Aye. And good riddance. Wizards build high — but they fall harder than most.

He set her on her feet as the rumbling subsided.

The remaining Afghulis — perhaps a dozen of the original warband — dropped to their knees, awed and terrified.

_*AFGHULI CAPTAIN (weakly)*_
Chief… you slew them. All of them. No man has ever… no tribe has ever…

_*CONAN*_
Save your breath. We’re not dead yet. And the mountain may have more tricks left.

But the trembling faded. The peaks stood silent once more.

Only a slow rain of dust drifted from the stars.

---

They descended toward a cluster of boulders where the air was clearer. The Afghulis sank gratefully onto the rocks. Conan lowered himself beside Yasmina, rolling his massive shoulders as though shrugging off the weight of battle.

She studied him — bruised, dust-covered, scorched by sorcery — and yet fierce, unbroken, grim as the mountains themselves.

_*YASMINA*_
Conan… I owe you more than life. You have slain the devils that murdered my brother… destroyed their stronghold… and saved me from their hands.

He grunted.

_*CONAN*_
I did what needed doing. And devils or no, no man steals a girl from under my arm without paying for it.

She lowered her eyes.

_*YASMINA*_
And… what price do *you* ask, Conan?

He looked at her — long, measuring — then laughed softly.

_*CONAN*_
I ask no price. I’m a hard man, girl, but not one to demand coin for saving beauty from a wizard’s curse.

She met his eyes again — this time without fear.

But before either could speak, an Afghuli warrior pointed downhill.

_*AFGHULI WARRIOR*_
Chief — dawn comes.

A pale glow crept along the ridges. The eastern sky brightened.

Yasmina shivered, though the rising light promised warmth.

_*YASMINA*_
What now, Conan? Where do we go? The tribes still hunt us… and Kerim Shah may yet lie in wait.

Conan rose, offering her a hand.

_*CONAN*_
We head for Afghulistan first. My tribe will rally behind me — enough to break any Vendhyan or Turanian party that crosses our trail.

He looked down the long, winding valley.

_*CONAN*_
And after that — Peshkhauri. There are things yet unfinished. A dead king’s murder. A throne unguarded. Schemes that stink of sorcerers still.

Yasmina’s breath caught.

_*YASMINA*_
You mean to bring me home?

_*CONAN (grinning)*_
Aye. You’ll ride into the capital with the biggest rogue in the Himelians at your side. That should give your council something to talk about.

He swung her lightly onto the stallion’s back and mounted behind her.

The Afghulis gathered around them, battered but alive.

_*AFGHULI CAPTAIN*_
Chief — where you lead, we follow. Through devils or kings.

_*CONAN*_
Then follow close. This tale isn’t done yet.

He flicked the reins.

The stallion reared, neighing at the dawn.

Conan wrapped one arm around Yasmina’s waist.

Together, they rode down the broken slopes — leaving behind the smoking ruins of Yimsha, the shattered Tower, and the corpses of the Black Seers whose sorcery had ruled the mountains for generations.

The sun lifted over the peaks.

A new day began.

And Chapter 6 ended.
