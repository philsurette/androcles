MEGAERA.
I won’t go another step.

ANDROCLES.
Oh, not again, dear. What’s the good of stopping
every two miles and saying you won’t go another step? We must get on to
the next village before night. There are wild beasts in this wood:
lions, they say.

MEGAERA.
I don’t believe a word of it. You are always threatening me with wild
beasts to make me walk the very soul out of my body when I can hardly
drag one foot before another. We haven’t seen a single lion yet.

ANDROCLES.
Well, dear, do you want to see one?

MEGAERA.
You cruel beast, you don’t care
how tired I am, or what becomes of me: always thinking of yourself. Self! self! self! always
yourself!

ANDROCLES.
We all have to think of ourselves occasionally, dear.

MEGAERA.
A man ought to think of his wife sometimes.

ANDROCLES.
He can’t always help it, dear. You make me think of you a good deal.
Not that I blame you.

MEGAERA.
Blame me! I should think not indeed. Is it my fault that I’m married to
you?

ANDROCLES.
No, dear: that is my fault.

MEGAERA.
That’s a nice thing to say to me. Aren’t you happy with me?

ANDROCLES.
I don’t complain, my love.

MEGAERA.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

ANDROCLES.
I am, my dear.

MEGAERA.
You’re not: you glory in it.

ANDROCLES.
In what, darling?

MEGAERA.
In everything. In making me a slave, and making yourself a
laughing-stock. Its not fair. You get me the name of being a shrew with
your meek ways, always talking as if butter wouldn’t melt in your
mouth. And just because I look a big strong woman, and because I’m
good-hearted and a bit hasty, and because you’re always driving me to
do things I’m sorry for afterwards, people say “Poor man: what a life
his wife leads him!” Oh, if they only knew! And you think I don’t know.
But I do, I do, I do.

ANDROCLES.
Yes, my dear: I know you do.

MEGAERA.
Then why don’t you treat me properly and be a good husband to me?

ANDROCLES.
What can I do, my dear?

MEGAERA.
What can you do! You can return to your duty, and come back to your
home and your friends, and sacrifice to the gods as all respectable
people do, instead of having us hunted out of house and home for being
dirty, disreputable, blaspheming atheists.

ANDROCLES.
I’m not an atheist, dear: I am a Christian.

MEGAERA.
Well, isn’t that the same thing, only ten times worse? Everybody knows
that the Christians are the very lowest of the low.

ANDROCLES.
Just like us, dear.

MEGAERA.
Speak for yourself. Don’t you dare to compare me to common people. My
father owned his own public-house; and sorrowful was the day for me
when you first came drinking in our bar.

ANDROCLES.
I confess I was addicted to it, dear. But I gave it up when I became a
Christian.

MEGAERA.
You’d much better have remained a drunkard. I can forgive a man being
addicted to drink: its only natural; and I don’t deny I like a drop
myself sometimes. What I can’t stand is your being addicted to
Christianity. And what’s worse again, your being addicted to animals.
How is any woman to keep her house clean when you bring in every stray
cat and lost cur and lame duck in the whole countryside? You took the
bread out of my mouth to feed them: you know you did: don’t attempt to
deny it.

ANDROCLES.
Only when they were hungry and you were getting too stout, dearie.

MEGAERA.
Yes, insult me, do. Oh! I won’t bear it another moment. You
used to sit and talk to those dumb brute beasts for hours, when you
hadn’t a word for me.

ANDROCLES.
They never answered back, darling.

MEGAERA.
Well, if you’re fonder of animals than of your own wife, you can live
with them here in the jungle. I’ve had enough of them and enough of
you. I’m going back. I’m going home.

ANDROCLES.
No, dearie: don’t take on like that. We can’t
go back. We’ve sold everything: we should starve; and I should be sent
to Rome and thrown to the lions—

MEGAERA.
Serve you right! I wish the lions joy of you. Are you
going to get out of my way and let me go home?

ANDROCLES.
No, dear—

MEGAERA.
Then I’ll make my way through the forest; and when I’m eaten by the
wild beasts you’ll know what a wife you’ve lost. Oh! Oh! Andy! Andy!

ANDROCLES.
What is it, my precious, my pet? What’s the matter?

MEGAERA.
No, Andy: you’ll be killed. Come back.

ANDROCLES.
Did you see? A lion.

MEGAERA.
The gods have sent him to punish us because you’re a
Christian. Take me away, Andy. Save me.

ANDROCLES.
Meggy: there’s one chance for you. It’ll take him pretty
nigh twenty minutes to eat me and you
can escape in less time than that.

MEGAERA.
Oh, don’t talk about eating. Oh! .

ANDROCLES.
Don’t you come
near my wife, do you hear? Meggy: run. Run for your life. If I take my eye
off him, its all up. Oh, he’s lame, poor old chap! He’s got a
thorn in his paw. A frightfully big thorn. Oh,
poor old man! Did um get an awful thorn into um’s tootsums wootsums?
Has it made um too sick to eat a nice little Christian man for um’s
breakfast? Oh, a nice little Christian man will get um’s thorn out for
um; and then um shall eat the nice Christian man and the nice Christian
man’s nice big tender wifey pifey. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Now, now 
um is not to bite and not to scratch, not even if it hurts a
very, very little. Now make velvet paws. That’s right. Steadeee!
Oh, did the nasty cruel little Christian man hurt the sore paw? Well, one more little pull
and it will be all over. Just one little, little, leetle pull; and then
um will live happily ever after. Oh, mustn’t
frighten um’s good kind doctor, um’s affectionate nursey. That didn’t
hurt at all: not a bit. Just one more. Just to show how the brave big
lion can bear pain, not like the little crybaby Christian man. Oopsh!
That’s it! . Now it’s out. Now lick
um’s paw to take away the nasty inflammation. See? 
Clever little liony-piony! Understands um’s dear old friend Andy Wandy.
Yes, kissums Andy Wandy. Velvet paws! Velvet paws!
That’s right.

MEGAERA.
Oh, you coward, you haven’t danced
with me for years; and now you go off dancing with a great brute beast
that you haven’t known for ten minutes and that wants to eat your own
wife. Coward! Coward! Coward! 

THE CENTURION.
Now
then, you Christians, none of your larks. The captain’s coming. Mind
you behave yourselves. No singing. Look respectful. Look serious, if
you’re capable of it. See that big building over there? That’s the
Coliseum. That’s where you’ll be thrown to the lions or set to fight
the gladiators presently. Think of that; and it’ll help you to behave
properly before the captain. Attention!
Salute!

CHRISTIAN1.
God bless you, Captain.

THE CENTURION.
Silence!

THE CAPTAIN.
Centurion.

THE CENTURION.
Sir?

THE CAPTAIN.
You will remind your men,
Centurion, that we are now entering Rome. You will instruct them that
once inside the gates of Rome they are in the presence of the Emperor.
You will make them understand that the lax discipline of the march
cannot be permitted here. You will instruct them to shave every day,
not every week. You will impress on them particularly that there must
be an end to the profanity and blasphemy of singing Christian hymns on
the march. I have to reprimand you, Centurion, for not only allowing
this, but actually doing it yourself.

THE CENTURION.
The men march better, Captain.

THE CAPTAIN.
No doubt. For that reason an exception is made in the case of the march
called Onward Christian Soldiers. This may be sung, except when
marching through the forum or within hearing of the Emperor’s palace;
but the words must be altered to “Throw them to the Lions.”

THE CENTURION.
Silence! Silen-n-n-n-nce! Where’s your behavior? Is that the way to
listen to an officer? That’s what we have to put up
with from these Christians every day, sir. They’re always laughing and
joking something scandalous. They’ve no religion: that’s how it is.

LAVINIA.
But I think the Captain meant us to laugh, Centurion. It was so funny.

THE CENTURION.
You’ll find out how funny it is when you’re thrown to the lions
to-morrow. Beg pardon, Sir.
Silennnnce!

THE CAPTAIN.
You are to instruct your men that all intimacy with Christian prisoners
must now cease. The men have fallen into habits of dependence upon the
prisoners, especially the female prisoners, for cooking, repairs to
uniforms, writing letters, and advice in their private affairs. In a
Roman soldier such dependence is inadmissible. Let me see no more of it
whilst we are in the city. Further, your orders are that in addressing
Christian prisoners, the manners and tone of your men must express
abhorrence and contempt. Any shortcoming in this respect will be
regarded as a breach of discipline. 
Prisoners.

THE CENTURION.
Prisonerrrrrs! Tention! Silence!

THE CAPTAIN.
I call your attention, prisoners, to the fact that you may be called on
to appear in the Imperial Circus at any time from tomorrow onwards
according to the requirements of the managers. I may inform you that as
there is a shortage of Christians just now, you may expect to be called
on very soon.

LAVINIA.
What will they do to us, Captain?

THE CENTURION.
Silence!

THE CAPTAIN.
The women will be conducted into the arena with the wild beasts of the
Imperial Menagerie, and will suffer the consequences. The men, if of an
age to bear arms, will be given weapons to defend themselves, if they
choose, against the Imperial Gladiators.

LAVINIA.
Captain: is there no hope that this cruel persecution—

THE CENTURION.
Silence! Hold your tongue, there. Persecution, indeed!

THE CAPTAIN.
Persecution is not a term applicable
to the acts of the Emperor. The Emperor is the Defender of the Faith.
In throwing you to the lions he will be upholding the interests of
religion in Rome. If you were to throw him to the lions, that would no
doubt be persecution.

THE CENTURION.
Silence, I tell you! Keep silence there. Did anyone ever
hear the like of this?

LAVINIA.
Captain: there will be nobody to appreciate your jokes when we are
gone.

THE CAPTAIN.
I call the attention of the
female prisoner Lavinia to the fact that as the Emperor is a divine
personage, her imputation of cruelty is not only treason, but
sacrilege. I point out to her further that there is no foundation for
the charge, as the Emperor does not desire that any prisoner should
suffer; nor can any Christian be harmed save through his or her own
obstinacy. All that is necessary is to sacrifice to the gods: a simple
and convenient ceremony effected by dropping a pinch of incense on the
altar, after which the prisoner is at once set free. Under such
circumstances you have only your own perverse folly to blame if you
suffer. I suggest to you that if you cannot burn a morsel of incense as
a matter of conviction, you might at least do so as a matter of good
taste, to avoid shocking the religious convictions of your fellow
citizens. I am aware that these considerations do not weigh with
Christians; but it is my duty to call your attention to them in order
that you may have no ground for complaining of your treatment, or of
accusing the Emperor of cruelty when he is showing you the most signal
clemency. Looked at from this point of view, every Christian who has
perished in the arena has really committed suicide.

LAVINIA.
Captain: your jokes are too grim. Do not think it is easy for us to
die. Our faith makes life far stronger and more wonderful in us than
when we walked in darkness and had nothing to live for. Death is harder
for us than for you: the martyr’s agony is as bitter as his triumph is
glorious.

THE CAPTAIN.
A martyr,
Lavinia, is a fool. Your death will prove nothing.

LAVINIA.
Then why kill me?

THE CAPTAIN.
I mean that truth, if there be any truth, needs no martyrs.

LAVINIA.
No; but my faith, like your sword, needs testing. Can you test your
sword except by staking your life on it?

THE CAPTAIN.
I call the attention of the
female prisoner to the fact that Christians are not allowed to draw the
Emperor’s officers into arguments and put questions to them for which
the military regulations provide no answer.

LAVINIA.
Captain: how CAN you?

THE CAPTAIN.
I call the female prisoner’s attention specially to the fact that four
comfortable homes have been offered her by officers of this regiment,
of which she can have her choice the moment she chooses to sacrifice as
all well-bred Roman ladies do. I have no more to say to the prisoners.

THE CENTURION.
Dismiss! But stay where you are.

THE CAPTAIN.
Centurion: you will remain here with your men in charge of the
prisoners until the arrival of three Christian prisoners in the custody
of a cohort of the tenth legion. Among these prisoners you will
particularly identify an armorer named Ferrovius, of dangerous
character and great personal strength, and a Greek tailor reputed to be
a sorcerer, by name Androcles. You will add the three to your charge
here and march them all to the Coliseum, where you will deliver them
into the custody of the master of the gladiators and take his receipt,
countersigned by the keeper of the beasts and the acting manager. You
understand your instructions?

THE CENTURION.
Yes, Sir.

THE CAPTAIN.
Dismiss.

LAVINIA.
Captain: is this man who is to join us the famous Ferrovius, who has
made such wonderful conversions in the northern cities?

THE CAPTAIN.
Yes. We are warned that he has the strength of an elephant and the
temper of a mad bull. Also that he is stark mad. Not a model Christian,
it would seem.

LAVINIA.
You need not fear him if he is a Christian, Captain.

THE CAPTAIN.
I shall not fear him in any case, Lavinia.

LAVINIA.
How brave of you, Captain!

THE CAPTAIN.
You are right: it was silly thing to say. Lavinia: do Christians know how to love?

LAVINIA.
Yes, Captain: they love even their enemies.

THE CAPTAIN.
Is that easy?

LAVINIA.
Very easy, Captain, when their enemies are as handsome as you.

THE CAPTAIN.
Lavinia: you are laughing at me.

LAVINIA.
At you, Captain! Impossible.

THE CAPTAIN.
Then you are flirting with me, which is worse. Don’t be foolish.

LAVINIA.
But such a very handsome captain.

THE CAPTAIN.
Incorrigible! Listen to me. The men in that audience
tomorrow will be the vilest of voluptuaries: men in whom the only
passion excited by a beautiful woman is a lust to see her tortured and
torn shrieking limb from limb. It is a crime to dignify that passion.
It is offering yourself for violation by the whole rabble of the
streets and the riff-raff of the court at the same time. Why will you
not choose rather a kindly love and an honorable alliance?

LAVINIA.
They cannot violate my soul. I alone can do that by sacrificing to
false gods.

THE CAPTAIN.
Sacrifice then to the true God. What does his name matter? We call him
Jupiter. The Greeks call him Zeus. Call him what you will as you drop
the incense on the altar flame: He will understand.

LAVINIA.
No. I couldn’t. That is the strange thing, Captain, that a little pinch
of incense should make all that difference. Religion is such a great
thing that when I meet really religious people we are friends at once,
no matter what name we give to the divine will that made us and moves
us. Oh, do you think that I, a woman, would quarrel with you for
sacrificing to a woman god like Diana, if Diana meant to you what
Christ means to me? No: we should kneel side by side before her altar
like two children. But when men who believe neither in my god nor in
their own—men who do not know the meaning of the word religion—when
these men drag me to the foot of an iron statue that has become the
symbol of the terror and darkness through which they walk, of their
cruelty and greed, of their hatred of God and their oppression of
man—when they ask me to pledge my soul before the people that this
hideous idol is God, and that all this wickedness and falsehood is
divine truth, I cannot do it, not if they could put a thousand cruel
deaths on me. I tell you, it is physically impossible. Listen, Captain:
did you ever try to catch a mouse in your hand? Once there was a dear
little mouse that used to come out and play on my table as I was
reading. I wanted to take him in my hand and caress him; and sometimes
he got among my books so that he could not escape me when I stretched
out my hand. And I did stretch out my hand; but it always came back in
spite of me. I was not afraid of him in my heart; but my hand refused:
it is not in the nature of my hand to touch a mouse. Well, Captain, if
I took a pinch of incense in my hand and stretched it out over the
altar fire, my hand would come back. My body would be true to my faith
even if you could corrupt my mind. And all the time I should believe
more in Diana than my persecutors have ever believed in anything. Can
you understand that?

THE CAPTAIN.
Yes: I understand that. But my hand would not come back. The
hand that holds the sword has been trained not to come back from
anything but victory.

LAVINIA.
Not even from death?

THE CAPTAIN.
Least of all from death.

LAVINIA.
Then I must not come back either. A woman has to be braver than a
soldier.

THE CAPTAIN.
Prouder, you mean.

LAVINIA.
Prouder! You call our courage pride!

THE CAPTAIN.
There is no such thing as courage: there is only pride. You Christians
are the proudest devils on earth.

LAVINIA.
Pray God then my pride may never become a false pride. Thank you for trying to save me
from death.

THE CAPTAIN.
I knew it was no use; but one tries in spite of one’s knowledge.

LAVINIA.
Something stirs, even in the iron breast of a Roman soldier!

THE CAPTAIN.
It will soon be iron again. I have seen many women die, and forgotten
them in a week.

LAVINIA.
Remember me for a fortnight, handsome Captain. I shall be watching you,
perhaps.

THE CAPTAIN.
From the skies? Do not deceive yourself, Lavinia. There is no future
for you beyond the grave.

LAVINIA.
What does that matter? Do you think I am only running away from the
terrors of life into the comfort of heaven? If there were no future, or
if the future were one of torment, I should have to go just the same.
The hand of God is upon me.

THE CAPTAIN.
Yes: when all is said, we are both patricians, Lavinia, and must die
for our beliefs. Farewell.

THE CENTURION.
Cohort of the tenth with prisoners. Two file
out with me to receive them.

LENTULUS.
Christians, by Jove! Let’s chaff them.

METELLUS.
Awful brutes. If you knew as much about them as I do you wouldn’t want
to chaff them. Leave them to the lions.

LENTULUS.
That woman’s got a figure. 
Do you turn the other cheek when they kiss you?

LAVINIA.
What?

LENTULUS.
Do you turn the other cheek when they kiss you, fascinating Christian?

LAVINIA.
Don’t be foolish. Please don’t let your friend behave like a cad
before the soldiers. How are they to respect and obey patricians if
they see them behaving like street boys? Pull
yourself together, man. Hold your head up. Keep the corners of your
mouth firm; and treat me respectfully. What do you take me for?

LENTULUS.
Look here, you know: I—you—I—

LAVINIA.
Stuff! Go about your business. 

METELLUS.
You didn’t get much out of that. I told you they were brutes.

LENTULUS.
Plucky little filly! I suppose she thinks I care. 

THE CENTURION.
Here are some pals for you. This little bit is Ferrovius
that you talk so much about. Now
remember that you’re a Christian, and that you’ve got to return good
for evil. That’s the way to manage
them, eh! This fine fellow is a sorcerer. A
Greek tailor, he is. A real sorcerer, too: no mistake about it. The
tenth marches with a leopard at the head of the column. He made a pet
of the leopard; and now he’s crying at being parted from it. Ain’t you, old chap? Well, cheer up,
we march with a Billy goat that’s killed two
leopards and ate a turkey-cock. You can have him for a pet if you like.
This dirty dog is a real Christian. He mobs the temples, he does; he
goes smashing things mad drunk, he does; he steals the gold vessels, he
does; he assaults the priestesses, he does pah! You’re the sort that makes
duty a pleasure, you are.

SPINTHO.
That’s it: strangle me. Kick me. Beat me. Revile me. Our
Lord was beaten and reviled. That’s my way to heaven. Every martyr goes
to heaven, no matter what he’s done. That is so, isn’t it, brother?

THE CENTURION.
Well, if you’re going to heaven, I don’t want to go there. I wouldn’t
be seen with you.

LENTULUS.
Haw! Good! . Is this one of the
turn-the-other-cheek gentlemen, Centurion?

THE CENTURION.
Yes, sir. Lucky for you too, sir, if you want to take any liberties
with him.

LENTULUS.
You turn the other cheek when you’re struck, I’m told.

FERROVIUS.
Yes, by the grace of God, I
do, now.

LENTULUS.
Not that you’re a coward, of course; but out of pure piety.

FERROVIUS.
I fear God more than man; at least I try to.

LENTULUS.
Let’s see. You know, I should feel ashamed if I let
myself be struck like that, and took it lying down. But then I’m not a
Christian: I’m a man. 

FERROVIUS.
I have not always been faithful.
The first man who struck me as you have just struck me was a stronger
man than you: he hit me harder than I expected. I was tempted and fell;
and it was then that I first tasted bitter shame. I never had a happy
moment after that until I had knelt and asked his forgiveness by his
bedside in the hospital. But now I have learnt to resist with a strength
that is not my own. I am not ashamed now, nor angry.

LENTULUS.
Er—good evening. 

FERROVIUS.
Oh, do not harden your heart, young man.
Come: try for yourself whether our way is not better than yours. I will
now strike you on one cheek; and you will turn the other and learn how
much better you will feel than if you gave way to the promptings of
anger.

LENTULUS.
Centurion: I call on you to protect me.

THE CENTURION.
You asked for it, sir. It’s no business of ours. You’ve had two whacks
at him. Better pay him a trifle and square it that way.

LENTULUS.
Yes, of course. It was only a bit of fun, I assure
you: I meant no harm. Here.

FERROVIUS.
Give all thou hast to the poor.
Come, friend: courage! I may hurt your body for a moment; but your soul
will rejoice in the victory of the spirit over the flesh.

ANDROCLES.
Easy, Ferrovius, easy: you broke the last man’s jaw.

FERROVIUS.
Yes; but I saved his soul. What matters a broken jaw?

LENTULUS.
Don’t touch me, do you hear? The law—

FERROVIUS.
The law will throw me to the lions tomorrow: what worse could it do
were I to slay you? Pray for strength; and it shall be given to you.

LENTULUS.
Let me go. Your religion forbids you to strike me.

FERROVIUS.
On the contrary, it commands me to strike you. How can you turn the
other cheek, if you are not first struck on the one cheek?

LENTULUS.
But I’m convinced already that what you said is
quite right. I apologize for striking you.

FERROVIUS.
My son: have I softened your heart? Has the good
seed fallen in a fruitful place? Are your feet turning towards a better
path?

LENTULUS.
Yes, yes. There’s a great deal in what you say.

FERROVIUS.
Join us. Come to the lions. Come to suffering and death.

LENTULUS.
Oh, help me. Mother!
mother!

FERROVIUS.
These tears will water your soul and make it bring forth good fruit, my
son. God has greatly blessed my efforts at conversion. Shall I tell you
a miracle—yes, a miracle—wrought by me in Cappadocia? A young man—just
such a one as you, with golden hair like yours—scoffed at and struck me
as you scoffed at and struck me. I sat up all night with that youth
wrestling for his soul; and in the morning not only was he a Christian,
but his hair was as white as snow.
There, there: take him away. The spirit has overwrought him, poor lad.
Carry him gently to his house; and leave the rest to heaven.

THE CENTURION.
Take him home. 

FERROVIUS.
You are his friend, young man. You will see that he is taken safely
home.

METELLUS.
Certainly, sir. I shall do whatever you
think best. Most happy to have made your acquaintance, I’m sure. You
may depend on me. Good evening, sir.

FERROVIUS.
The blessing of heaven upon you and him.

LAVINIA.
So that is how you convert people, Ferrovius.

FERROVIUS.
Yes: there has been a blessing on my work in spite of my unworthiness
and my backslidings—all through my wicked, devilish temper. This man—

ANDROCLES.
Don’t slap me on the back, brother. She knows you mean me.

FERROVIUS.
How I wish I were weak like our brother here! for then I should perhaps
be meek and gentle like him. And yet there seems to be a special
providence that makes my trials less than his. I hear tales of the
crowd scoffing and casting stones and reviling the brethren; but when I
come, all this stops: my influence calms the passions of the mob: they
listen to me in silence; and infidels are often converted by a straight
heart-to-heart talk with me. Every day I feel happier, more confident.
Every day lightens the load of the great terror.

LAVINIA.
The great terror? What is that?

ANDROCLES.
Well, you see, sister, he’s never quite sure of himself. Suppose at the
last moment in the arena, with the gladiators there to fight him, one
of them was to say anything to annoy him, he might forget himself and
lay that gladiator out.

LAVINIA.
That would be splendid.

FERROVIUS.
What!

ANDROCLES.
Oh, sister!

FERROVIUS.
Splendid to betray my master, like Peter! Splendid to act like any
common blackguard in the day of my proving! Woman: you are no
Christian. 

LAVINIA.
You know, Ferrovius, I am not always a Christian. I don’t
think anybody is. There are moments when I forget all about it, and
something comes out quite naturally, as it did then.

SPINTHO.
What does it matter? If you die in the arena, you’ll be a martyr; and
all martyrs go to heaven, no matter what they have done. That’s so,
isn’t it, Ferrovius?

FERROVIUS.
Yes: that is so, if we are faithful to the end.

LAVINIA.
I’m not so sure.

SPINTHO.
Don’t say that. That’s blasphemy. Don’t say that, I tell you. We shall
be saved, no matter WHAT we do.

LAVINIA.
Perhaps you men will all go into heaven bravely and in triumph, with
your heads erect and golden trumpets sounding for you. But I am sure I
shall only be allowed to squeeze myself in through a little crack in
the gate after a great deal of begging. I am not good always: I have
moments only.

SPINTHO.
You’re talking nonsense, woman. I tell you, martyrdom pays all scores.

ANDROCLES.
Well, let us hope so, brother, for your sake. You’ve had a gay time,
haven’t you? with your raids on the temples. I can’t help thinking that
heaven will be very dull for a man of your temperament. Don’t be angry: I say it only to console you in case you
should die in your bed tonight in the natural way. There’s a lot of
plague about.

SPINTHO.
I never thought of that.
O Lord, spare me to be martyred. Oh, what a thought to put into the
mind of a brother! Oh, let me be martyred today, now. I shall die in
the night and go to hell. You’re a sorcerer: you’ve put death into my
mind. Oh, curse you, curse you! 

FERROVIUS.
What’s this, brother? Anger!
Violence! Raising your hand to a brother Christian!

SPINTHO.
It’s easy for you. You’re strong. Your nerves are all right. But I’m
full of disease. I’ve drunk all my nerves away. I shall have the horrors all
night.

ANDROCLES.
Oh, don’t take on so, brother. We’re all sinners.

SPINTHO.
Yes: I daresay if the truth
were known, you’re all as bad as I am.

LAVINIA.
Does that comfort you?

FERROVIUS.
Pray, man, pray.

SPINTHO.
What’s the good of praying? If we’re martyred we shall go to heaven,
shan’t we, whether we pray or not?

FERROVIUS.
What’s that? Not pray! Pray this instant, you
dog, you rotten hound, you slimy snake, you beastly goat, or—

SPINTHO.
Yes: beat me: kick me. I forgive you: mind that.

FERROVIUS.
Yah! 

ANDROCLES.
Dear
brother: if you wouldn’t mind—just for my sake—

FERROVIUS.
Well?

ANDROCLES.
Don’t call him by the names of the animals. We’ve no right to. I’ve had
such friends in dogs. A pet snake is the best of company. I was nursed
on goat’s milk. Is it fair to them to call the like of him a dog or a
snake or a goat?

FERROVIUS.
I only meant that they have no souls.

ANDROCLES.
Oh, believe me, they have. Just the same as
you and me. I really don’t think I could consent to go to heaven if I
thought there were to be no animals there. Think of what they suffer
here.

FERROVIUS.
That’s true. Yes: that is just. They will have their share in heaven.

SPINTHO.
(sneers)

FERROVIUS.
What’s that you say?

SPINTHO.
Nothing.

FERROVIUS.
Do animals go to heaven or not?

SPINTHO.
I never said they didn’t.

FERROVIUS.
Do they or do they not?

SPINTHO.
They do: they do. Oh, curse
you for frightening me!

THE CENTURION.
Tention! Form as before. Now then, prisoners, up with you
and trot along spry.

THE KEEPER.
Here, you soldiers! clear out of the way for the Emperor.

THE CENTURION.
Emperor! Where’s the Emperor? You ain’t the Emperor, are you?

THE KEEPER.
It’s the menagerie service. My team of oxen is drawing the new lion to
the Coliseum. You clear the road.

THE CENTURION.
What! Go in after you in your dust, with half the town at the heels of
you and your lion! Not likely. We go first.

THE KEEPER.
The menagerie service is the Emperor’s personal retinue. You clear out,
I tell you.

THE CENTURION.
You tell me, do you? Well, I’ll tell you something. If the lion is
menagerie service, the lion’s dinner is menagerie service too. This
is the lion’s dinner. So back with you
to your bullocks double quick; and learn your place. March. Now then, you Christians, step out there.

LAVINIA.
Come along, the rest of the dinner. I shall be the olives
and anchovies.

CHRISTIAN1.
I shall be the soup.

CHRISTIAN2. I shall be the fish.

CHRISTIAN3. Ferrovius shall be the roast boar.

FERROVIUS.
I see the joke. Yes, yes: I shall be the roast boar. Ha!
ha! .

ANDROCLES.
I shall be the mince pie. 

THE CENTURION.
Silence! Have some sense of your situation. Is this the
way for martyrs to behave? 
I know what you’ll be at that dinner. You’ll be the emetic. 

SPINTHO.
It’s too dreadful: I’m not fit to die.

THE CENTURION.
Fitter than you are to live, you swine.

THE CALL BOY.
Number six. Retiarius versus Secutor.

LAVINIA.
Will they really kill one another?

SPINTHO.
Yes, if the people turn down their thumbs.

THE EDITOR.
You know nothing about it. The people indeed! Do you suppose we would
kill a man worth perhaps fifty talents to please the riffraff? I should
like to catch any of my men at it.

SPINTHO.
I thought—

THE EDITOR.
You thought! Who cares what you think? You’ll be
killed all right enough.

SPINTHO.
!!! Then is nobody ever killed
except us poor—

LAVINIA.
Christians?

THE EDITOR.
If the vestal virgins turn down their thumbs, that’s another matter.
They’re ladies of rank.

LAVINIA.
Does the Emperor ever interfere?

THE EDITOR.
Oh, yes: he turns his thumbs up fast enough if the vestal virgins want
to have one of his pet fighting men killed.

ANDROCLES.
But don’t they ever just only pretend to kill one another? Why
shouldn’t you pretend to die, and get dragged out as if you were dead;
and then get up and go home, like an actor?

THE EDITOR.
See here: you want to know too much. There will be no pretending about
the new lion: let that be enough for you. He’s hungry.

SPINTHO.
Oh, Lord! Can’t you stop talking about it?
Isn’t it bad enough for us without that?

ANDROCLES.
I’m glad he’s hungry. Not that I want him to suffer, poor chap! but
then he’ll enjoy eating me so much more. There’s a cheerful side to
everything.

THE EDITOR.
Here: don’t you be obstinate.
Come with me and drop the pinch of incense on the altar. That’s all you
need do to be let off.

ANDROCLES.
No: thank you very much indeed; but I really mustn’t.

THE EDITOR.
What! Not to save your life?

ANDROCLES.
I’d rather not. I couldn’t sacrifice to Diana: she’s a huntress, you
know, and kills things.

THE EDITOR.
That don’t matter. You can choose your own altar. Sacrifice to Jupiter:
he likes animals: he turns himself into an animal when he goes off
duty.

ANDROCLES.
No: it’s very kind of you; but I feel I can’t save myself that way.

THE EDITOR.
But I don’t ask you to do it to save yourself: I ask you to do it to
oblige me personally.

ANDROCLES.
Oh, please don’t say that.
That is dreadful. You mean so kindly by me that it seems quite horrible
to disoblige you. If you could arrange for me to sacrifice when there’s
nobody looking, I shouldn’t mind. But I must go into the arena with the
rest. My honor, you know.

THE EDITOR.
Honor! The honor of a tailor?

ANDROCLES.
Well, perhaps honor is too strong an expression.
Still, you know, I couldn’t allow the tailors to get a bad name through
me.

THE EDITOR.
How much will you remember of all that when you smell the beast’s
breath and see his jaws opening to tear out your throat?

SPINTHO.
I can’t bear it. Where’s the altar?
I’ll sacrifice.

FERROVIUS.
Dog of an apostate. Iscariot!

SPINTHO.
I’ll repent afterwards. I fully mean to die in the arena I’ll die a
martyr and go to heaven; but not this time, not now, not until my
nerves are better. Besides, I’m too young: I want to have just one more
good time. Oh, will no one tell me
where the altar is? .

ANDROCLES.
Brother: I can’t do that, not
even to oblige you. Don’t ask me.

THE EDITOR.
Well, if you’re determined to die, I can’t help you. But I wouldn’t be
put off by a swine like that.

FERROVIUS.
Peace, peace: tempt him not. Get thee behind him, Satan.

THE EDITOR.
For two pins I’d take a turn in the arena myself
to-day, and pay you out for daring to talk to me like that.

LAVINIA.
Brother, brother: you forget.

FERROVIUS.
Oh, my temper, my wicked temper!
Forgive me,
brother. My heart was full of wrath: I should have been thinking of
your dear precious soul.

THE EDITOR.
Yah! 

FERROVIUS.
And I forgot it all: I thought of nothing but offering
to fight you with one hand tied behind me.

THE EDITOR.
What!

FERROVIUS.
Oh, don’t give way to
pride and wrath, brother. I could do it so easily. I could—

THE KEEPER.
Here’s a nice business! Who let that Christian out of here down to the
dens when we were changing the lion into the cage next the arena?

THE EDITOR.
Nobody let him. He let himself.

THE KEEPER.
Well, the lion’s ate him.

LAVINIA. Oh, poor wretch! FERROVIUS. The apostate has perished. Praise
be to God’s justice! ANDROCLES. The poor beast was starving. It
couldn’t help itself. THE CHRISTIANS. What! Ate him! How frightful! How
terrible! Without a moment to repent! God be merciful to him, a sinner!
Oh, I can’t bear to think of it! In the midst of his sin! Horrible,
horrible! THE EDITOR. Serve the rotter right! THE GLADIATORS. Just
walked into it, he did. He’s martyred all right enough. Good old lion!
Old Jock doesn’t like that: look at his face. Devil a better! The
Emperor will laugh when he hears of it. I can’t help smiling. Ha ha
ha!!!!!

THE KEEPER.
Now his appetite’s taken off, he won’t as much as look at another
Christian for a week.

ANDROCLES.
Couldn’t you have saved him brother?

THE KEEPER.
Saved him! Saved him from a lion that I’d just got mad with hunger! a
wild one that came out of the forest not four weeks ago! He bolted him
before you could say Balbus.

LAVINIA.
Poor Spintho! And it won’t even count as
martyrdom!

THE KEEPER.
Serve him right! What call had he to walk down the throat of one of my
lions before he was asked?

ANDROCLES.
Perhaps the lion won’t eat me now.

THE KEEPER.
Yes: that’s just like a Christian: think only of yourself! What am I to
do? What am I to say to the Emperor when he sees one of my lions coming
into the arena half asleep?

THE EDITOR.
Say nothing. Give your old lion some bitters and a morsel of fried fish
to wake up his appetite.

THE KEEPER.
Yes: it’s easy for you to talk; but—

THE EDITOR.
Sh! Attention there! The Emperor.

CAESAR enters on the Christians’ side, conversing with Metellus,
and followed by his suite.

THE GLADIATORS.
Hail, Caesar! those about to die salute thee.

CAESAR.
Good morrow, friends.

LAVINIA.
Blessing, Caesar, and forgiveness!

CAESAR.
There is no forgiveness
for Christianity.

LAVINIA.
I did not mean that, Caesar. I mean that we forgive you.

METELLUS.
An inconceivable liberty! Do you not know, woman, that the Emperor can
do no wrong and therefore cannot be forgiven?

LAVINIA.
I expect the Emperor knows better. Anyhow, we forgive him.

THE CHRISTIANS. Amen!

CAESAR.
Metellus: you see now the disadvantage of too much severity. These
people have no hope; therefore they have nothing to restrain them from
saying what they like to me. They are almost as impertinent as the
gladiators. Which is the Greek sorcerer?

ANDROCLES.
Me, your Worship.

CAESAR.
My Worship! Good! A new title. Well, what miracles can you perform?

ANDROCLES.
I can cure warts by rubbing them with my tailor’s chalk; and I can live
with my wife without beating her.

CAESAR.
Is that all?

ANDROCLES.
You don’t know her, Caesar, or you wouldn’t say that.

CAESAR.
Ah, well, my friend, we shall no doubt contrive a happy release for
you. Which is Ferrovius?

FERROVIUS.
I am he.

CAESAR.
They tell me you can fight.

FERROVIUS.
It is easy to fight. I can die, Caesar.

CAESAR.
That is still easier, is it not?

FERROVIUS.
Not to me, Caesar. Death comes hard to my flesh; and fighting comes
very easily to my spirit O sinner
that I am! .

CAESAR.
Metellus: I should like to have this man in the Pretorian Guard.

METELLUS.
I should not, Caesar. He looks a spoilsport. There are men in whose
presence it is impossible to have any fun: men who are a sort of
walking conscience. He would make us all uncomfortable.

CAESAR.
For that reason, perhaps, it might be well to have him. An Emperor can
hardly have too many consciences. Listen, Ferrovius.
. You and your
friends shall not be outnumbered to-day in the arena. You shall have
arms; and there will be no more than one gladiator to each Christian.
If you come out of the arena alive, I will consider favorably any
request of yours, and give you a place in the Pretorian Guard. Even if
the request be that no questions be asked about your faith I shall
perhaps not refuse it.

FERROVIUS.
I will not fight. I will die. Better stand with the archangels than
with the Pretorian Guard.

CAESAR.
I cannot believe that the archangels—whoever they may be—would not
prefer to be recruited from the Pretorian Guard. However, as you
please. Come: let us see the show.

SECUTOR.
Ha, the Emperor. Now we shall see. Caesar: I ask you whether it is fair
for the Retiarius, instead of making a fair throw of his net at me, to
swish it along the ground and throw the dust in my eyes, and then catch
me when I’m blinded. If the vestals had not turned up their thumbs I
should have been a dead man.

CAESAR.
There is nothing in the rules against it.

SECUTOR.
Caesar: is it a dirty trick or is it not?

CAESAR.
It is a dusty one, my friend. Be on your guard
next time.

SECUTOR.
Let HIM be on his guard. Next time I’ll throw my sword at his heels and
strangle him with his own net before he can hop off. 
You see if I don’t. 

CAESAR.
These tricks are not wise, my friend.
The audience likes to see a dead man in all his beauty and splendor. If
you smudge his face and spoil his armor they will show their
displeasure by not letting you kill him. And when your turn comes, they
will remember it against you and turn their thumbs down.

THE RETIARIUS.
Perhaps that is why I did it, Caesar. He bet me ten sesterces that he
would vanquish me. If I had had to kill him I should not have had the
money.

CAESAR.
You rogues: there is no end to your tricks.
I’ll dismiss you all and have elephants to fight. They fight fairly.
The Call Boy
comes from the passage, followed by three attendants carrying
respectively a bundle of swords, some helmets, and some breastplates
and pieces of armor which they throw down in a heap.

THE CALL BOY.
By your leave, Caesar. Number eleven! Gladiators and Christians!

CAESAR.
The hour has come, Ferrovius. I
shall go into my box and see you killed, since you scorn the Pretorian
Guard.

LAVINIA.
Farewell.

THE EDITOR.
Steady there. You Christians have got to fight. Here! arm yourselves.

FERROVIUS.
I’ll die sword in hand to show people that I
could fight if it were my Master’s will, and that I could kill the man
who kills me if I chose.

THE EDITOR.
Put on that armor.

FERROVIUS.
No armor.

THE EDITOR.
Do what you’re told. Put on that armor.

FERROVIUS.
I said, No armor.

THE EDITOR.
And what am I to say when I am accused of sending a naked man in to
fight my men in armor?

FERROVIUS.
Say your prayers, brother; and have no fear of the princes of this
world.

THE EDITOR.
Tsha! You obstinate fool! 

ANDROCLES.
Farewell, brother, till we meet in the sweet
by-and-by.

THE EDITOR.
You are going too. Take a sword there; and put on any
armor you can find to fit you.

ANDROCLES.
No, really: I can’t fight: I never could. I can’t bring myself to
dislike anyone enough. I’m to be thrown to the lions with the lady.

THE EDITOR.
Then get out of the way and hold your noise. Now then! Are you all ready there?

FERROVIUS.
Heaven give me strength!

THE EDITOR.
Aha! That frightens you, does it?

FERROVIUS.
Man: there is no terror like the terror of that sound to me. When I
hear a trumpet or a drum or the clash of steel or the hum of the
catapult as the great stone flies, fire runs through my veins: I feel
my blood surge up hot behind my eyes: I must charge: I must strike: I
must conquer: Caesar himself will not be safe in his imperial seat if
once that spirit gets loose in me. Oh, brothers, pray! exhort me!
remind me that if I raise my sword my honor falls and my Master is
crucified afresh.

ANDROCLES.
Just keep thinking how cruelly you might hurt the poor gladiators.

FERROVIUS.
It does not hurt a man to kill him.

LAVINIA.
Nothing but faith can save you.

FERROVIUS.
Faith! Which faith? There are two faiths. There is our faith. And there
is the warrior’s faith, the faith in fighting, the faith that sees God
in the sword. How if that faith should overwhelm me?

LAVINIA.
You will find your real faith in the hour of trial.

FERROVIUS.
That is what I fear. I know that I am a fighter. How can I feel sure
that I am a Christian?

ANDROCLES.
Throw away the sword, brother.

FERROVIUS.
I cannot. It cleaves to my hand. I could as easily throw a woman I
loved from my arms. Who spoke that blasphemy? Not I.

LAVINIA.
I can’t help you, friend. I can’t tell you not to save your own life.
Something wilful in me wants to see you fight your way into heaven.

FERROVIUS.
Ha!

ANDROCLES.
But if you are going to give up our faith, brother, why not do it
without hurting anybody? Don’t fight them. Burn the incense.

FERROVIUS.
Burn the incense! Never.

LAVINIA.
That is only pride, Ferrovius.

FERROVIUS.
ONLY pride! What is nobler than pride? Oh, I’m
steeped in sin. I’m proud of my pride.

LAVINIA.
They say we Christians are the proudest devils on earth—that only the
weak are meek. Oh, I am worse than you. I ought to send you to death;
and I am tempting you.

ANDROCLES.
Brother, brother: let them rage and kill: let us be brave and suffer.
You must go as a lamb to the slaughter.

FERROVIUS.
Aye, aye: that is right. Not as a lamb is slain by the butcher; but as
a butcher might let himself be slain by a by
a silly ram whose head he could fetch off in one twist.

THE CALL BOY.
In with you: into the arena. The stage is waiting.

THE CAPTAIN.
CAESAR is waiting. What are you dreaming of,
man? Send your men in at once.

THE EDITOR.
Yes, Sir: it’s these Christians hanging back.

FERROVIUS.
Liar!

THE EDITOR.
March. Follow up there, you.

THE CHRISTIAN MEN AND WOMEN.
Be steadfast, brother. Farewell. Hold up the faith,
brother. Farewell. Go to glory, dearest. Farewell. Remember: we are
praying for you. Farewell. Be strong, brother. Farewell. Don’t forget
that the divine love and our love surround you. Farewell. Nothing can
hurt you: remember that, brother. Farewell. Eternal glory, dearest.
Farewell.

THE EDITOR.
Shove them in, there.

FERROVIUS.
Touch them, dogs; and we die here, and cheat the
heathen of their spectacle. Brothers: the
great moment has come. That passage is your hill to Calvary. Mount it
bravely, but meekly; and remember! not a word of reproach, not a blow
nor a struggle. Go. Farewell.

LAVINIA.
You forget: I must follow before you are cold.

FERROVIUS.
It is true. Do not envy me because I pass before you to glory. 

THE EDITOR.
Sickening work, this. Why can’t they all be thrown
to the lions? It’s not a man’s job. 

ANDROCLES.
I’m glad I haven’t to fight. That would really be an awful martyrdom. I
am lucky.

LAVINIA.
. Androcles: burn the incense:
you’ll be forgiven. Let my death atone for both. I feel as if I were
killing you.

ANDROCLES.
Don’t think of me, sister. Think of yourself. That will keep your heart
up.

THE CAPTAIN.
(laughs)

LAVINIA.
Are you there, handsome
Captain? Have you come to see me die?

THE CAPTAIN.
I am on duty with the Emperor, Lavinia.

LAVINIA.
Is it part of your duty to laugh at us?

THE CAPTAIN.
No: that is part of my private pleasure. Your friend here is a
humorist. I laughed at his telling you to think of yourself to keep up
your heart. I say, think of yourself and burn the incense.

LAVINIA.
He is not a humorist: he was right. You ought to know that, Captain:
you have been face to face with death.

THE CAPTAIN.
Not with certain death, Lavinia. Only death in battle, which spares
more men than death in bed. What you are facing is certain death. You
have nothing left now but your faith in this craze of yours: this
Christianity. Are your Christian fairy stories any truer than our
stories about Jupiter and Diana, in which, I may tell you, I believe no
more than the Emperor does, or any educated man in Rome?

LAVINIA.
Captain: all that seems nothing to me now. I’ll not say that death is a
terrible thing; but I will say that it is so real a thing that when it
comes close, all the imaginary things—all the stories, as you call
them—fade into mere dreams beside that inexorable reality. I know now
that I am not dying for stories or dreams. Did you hear of the dreadful
thing that happened here while we were waiting?

THE CAPTAIN.
I heard that one of your fellows bolted, and ran right into the jaws of
the lion. I laughed. I still laugh.

LAVINIA.
Then you don’t understand what that meant?

THE CAPTAIN.
It meant that the lion had a cur for his breakfast.

LAVINIA.
It meant more than that, Captain. It meant that a man cannot die for a
story and a dream. None of us believed the stories and the dreams more
devoutly than poor Spintho; but he could not face the great reality.
What he would have called my faith has been oozing away minute by
minute whilst I’ve been sitting here, with death coming nearer and
nearer, with reality becoming realler and realler, with stories and
dreams fading away into nothing.

THE CAPTAIN.
Are you then going to die for nothing?

LAVINIA.
Yes: that is the wonderful thing. It is since all the stories and
dreams have gone that I have now no doubt at all that I must die for
something greater than dreams or stories.

THE CAPTAIN.
But for what?

LAVINIA.
I don’t know. If it were for anything small enough to know, it would be
too small to die for. I think I’m going to die for God. Nothing else is
real enough to die for.

THE CAPTAIN.
What is God?

LAVINIA.
When we know that, Captain, we shall be gods ourselves.

THE CAPTAIN.
Lavinia; come down to earth. Burn the incense and marry me.

LAVINIA.
Handsome Captain: would you marry me if I hauled down the flag in the
day of battle and burnt the incense? Sons take after their mothers, you
know. Do you want your son to be a coward?

THE CAPTAIN.
By great Diana, I think I would strangle you if you
gave in now.

LAVINIA.
The hand of God is on us
three, Captain.

THE CAPTAIN.
What nonsense it all is! And what a monstrous thing that you should die
for such nonsense, and that I should look on helplessly when my whole
soul cries out against it! Die then if you must; but at least I can cut
CAESAR’s throat and then my own when I see your blood.

CAESAR throws open the door of his box angrily, and appears in
wrath on the threshold. The Editor, the Call Boy, and the gladiators
spring to their feet.

CAESAR.
The Christians will not fight; and your curs cannot get their blood up
to attack them. It’s all that fellow with the blazing eyes. Send for
the whip. If
that will not move them, bring the hot irons. The man is like a
mountain.

LAVINIA.
Oh, that is unworthy. Can they not kill him without
dishonoring him?

ANDROCLES.
It’s dreadful. Now I want to fight. I can’t
bear the sight of a whip. The only time I ever hit a man was when he
lashed an old horse with a whip. It was terrible: I danced on his face
when he was on the ground. He mustn’t strike Ferrovius: I’ll go into
the arena and kill him first.

THE EDITOR.
What’s up now?

LAVINIA.
What has happened, do you think?

THE CAPTAIN.
What CAN happen? They are killing them, I suppose.

ANDROCLES.
(runs in)

LAVINIA.
Androcles, Androcles: what’s the matter?

ANDROCLES.
Oh, don’t ask me, don’t ask me. Something too dreadful. Oh! 

THE CALL BOY. Ropes and
hooks there! Ropes and hooks.

THE EDITOR.
Well, need you excite yourself about it? How many dead?

THE CALL BOY.
Six. And the basket.
Bring the baskets. 

THE CAPTAIN.
Who are the baskets for?

THE CALL BOY.
For the whip. He’s in pieces. They’re all in pieces, more or less.

Boys, he’s killed the lot.

CAESAR.
Where is he? Magnificent! He shall have a laurel crown.

FERROVIUS.
Lost! lost forever! I have betrayed my Master. Cut off this right hand:
it has offended. Ye have swords, my brethren: strike.

LAVINIA.
No, no. What have you done, Ferrovius?

FERROVIUS.
I know not; but there was blood behind my eyes; and there’s blood on my
sword. What does that mean?

CAESAR.
What does it mean?
It means that you are the greatest man in Rome. It means that you shall
have a laurel crown of gold. Superb fighter, I could almost yield you
my throne. It is a record for my reign: I shall live in history. Once,
in Domitian’s time, a Gaul slew three men in the arena and gained his
freedom. But when before has one naked man slain six armed men of the
bravest and best? The persecution shall cease: if Christians can fight
like this, I shall have none but Christians to fight for me. You are ordered to become Christians, you there: do you
hear?

RETIARIUS. It is all one to us, Caesar. Had I been there with my net,
the story would have been different.

THE CAPTAIN.
Caesar this woman is the sister of Ferrovius. If she
is thrown to the lions he will fret. He will lose weight; get out of
condition.

CAESAR.
The lions? Nonsense! Madam: I am proud to have the honor
of making your acquaintance. Your brother is the glory of Rome.

LAVINIA.
But my friends here. Must they die?

CAESAR.
Die! Certainly not. There has never been the slightest idea of harming
them. Ladies and gentlemen: you are all free. Pray go into the front of
the house and enjoy the spectacle to which your brother has so
splendidly contributed. Captain: oblige me by conducting them to the
seats reserved for my personal friends.

THE KEEPER.
Caesar: I must have one Christian for the lion. The people have been
promised it; and they will tear the decorations to bits if they are
disappointed.

CAESAR.
True, true: we must have somebody for the new lion.

FERROVIUS.
Throw me to him. Let the apostate perish.

CAESAR.
No, no: you would tear him in pieces, my friend; and we cannot afford
to throw away lions as if they were mere slaves. But we must have
somebody. This is really extremely awkward.

THE KEEPER.
Why not that little Greek chap? He’s not a Christian: he’s a sorcerer.

CAESAR.
The very thing: he will do very well.

THE CALL BOY. Number twelve. The Christian
for the new lion.

ANDROCLES.
Well, it was to be,
after all.

LAVINIA.
I’ll go in his place, Caesar. Ask the Captain whether they do not like
best to see a woman torn to pieces. He told me so yesterday.

CAESAR.
There is something in that: there is certainly something in that—if
only I could feel sure that your brother would not fret.

ANDROCLES.
No: I should never have another happy hour. No: on the faith of a
Christian and the honor of a tailor, I accept the lot that has fallen
on me. If my wife turns up, give her my love and say that my wish was
that she should be happy with her next, poor fellow! Caesar: go to your
box and see how a tailor can die. Make way for number twelve there.

CAESAR.
My friends, an incredible! an amazing thing! has happened. I can no
longer doubt the truth of Christianity. This Christian sorcerer—

ANDROCLES.
Now I wonder why they all run away from us like that. 

CAESAR.
Sorcerer: I command you to put that lion to death instantly. It is
guilty of high treason. Your conduct is most disgra—  help! 

ANDROCLES.
Don’t run away, sir: he can’t help springing if you run. 
Don’t be afraid of him.

CAESAR.
I am NOT afraid of him. Keep between us.

ANDROCLES.
Never be afraid of animals, your Worship: that’s the great secret.
He’ll be as gentle as a lamb when he knows that you are his friend.
Stand quite still; and smile; and let him smell you all over just to
reassure him; for, you see, he’s afraid of you; and he must examine you
thoroughly before he gives you his confidence. Come
now, Tommy; and speak nicely to the Emperor, the great, good Emperor
who has power to have all our heads cut off if we don’t behave very,
VERY respectfully to him.

ANDROCLES.
Oh bad wicked Tommy, to chase the Emperor like that! Let go the
Emperor’s robe at once, sir: where’s your manners? Don’t pull it away from him, your worship. He’s
only playing. Now I shall be really angry with you, Tommy, if you don’t
let go. I’ll tell you what it is, sir: he
thinks you and I are not friends.

CAESAR.
Friends! You infernal
scoundrel don’t let him go. Curse this brooch! I
can’t get it loose.

ANDROCLES.
We mustn’t let him lash himself into a rage. You must show him that you
are my particular friend—if you will have the condescension. Look, Tommy:
the nice Emperor is the dearest friend Andy Wandy has in the whole
world: he loves him like a brother.

CAESAR.
You little brute, you damned filthy little dog of a Greek tailor: I’ll
have you burnt alive for daring to touch the divine person of the
Emperor.

ANDROCLES.
Oh don’t talk like that, sir. He understands every word you say: all
animals do: they take it from the tone of your voice. I think he’s going to spring at your worship. If
you wouldn’t mind saying something affectionate.

CAESAR.
My dearest Mr. Androcles, my
sweetest friend, my long lost brother, come to my arms. Oh, what an abominable smell of garlic!

ANDROCLES.
There! You see, your worship, a child might play with him now. See!
Come and pet him.

CAESAR.
I must conquer these unkingly terrors. Mind you don’t go away from him,
though.

ANDROCLES.
Oh, sir, how few men would have the courage to do that—

CAESAR.
Yes: it takes a bit of nerve. Let us invite the Court in and frighten
them. Is he safe, do you think?

ANDROCLES.
Quite safe now, sir.

CAESAR.
What ho, there! All who are within hearing, return
without fear. Caesar has tamed the lion. Take those things away. I
have subdued the beast.

FERROVIUS.
It is strange that I, who fear no man, should fear a lion.

THE CAPTAIN.
Every man fears something, Ferrovius.

CAESAR.
How about the Pretorian Guard now?

FERROVIUS.
In my youth I worshipped Mars, the God of War. I turned from him to
serve the Christian god; but today the Christian god forsook me; and
Mars overcame me and took back his own. The Christian god is not yet.
He will come when Mars and I are dust; but meanwhile I must serve the
gods that are, not the God that will be. Until then I accept service in
the Guard, Caesar.

CAESAR.
Very wisely said. All really sensible men agree that the prudent course
is to be neither bigoted in our attachment to the old nor rash and
unpractical in keeping an open mind for the new, but to make the best
of both dispensations.

THE CAPTAIN.
What do you say, Lavinia? Will you too be prudent?

LAVINIA.
No: I’ll strive for the coming of the God who is not
yet.

THE CAPTAIN.
May I come and argue with you occasionally?

LAVINIA.
Yes, handsome Captain: you may.

CAESAR.
And now, my friends, though I do not, as you see, fear this lion, yet
the strain of his presence is considerable; for none of us can feel
quite sure what he will do next.

THE KEEPER.
Caesar: give us this Greek sorcerer to be a slave in the menagerie. He
has a way with the beasts.

ANDROCLES.
Not if they are in cages. They should not be kept in
cages. They must all be let out.

CAESAR.
I give this sorcerer to be a slave to the first man who lays hands on
him. You see how
magnanimous we Romans are, Androcles. We suffer you to go in peace.

ANDROCLES.
I thank your worship. I thank you all, ladies and gentlemen. Come,
Tommy. Whilst we stand together, no cage for you: no slavery for me.
