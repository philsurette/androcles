Christians, by Jove! Let’s chaff them.
That woman’s got a figure. Do you turn the other cheek when they kiss you?
Do you turn the other cheek when they kiss you, fascinating Christian?
Look here, you know: I—you—I—
Plucky little filly! I suppose she thinks I care.
Haw! Good! . Is this one of the turn-the-other-cheek gentlemen, Centurion?
You turn the other cheek when you’re struck, I’m told.
Not that you’re a coward, of course; but out of pure piety.
Let’s see. You know, I should feel ashamed if I let myself be struck like that, and took it lying down. But then I’m not a Christian: I’m a man.
Er—good evening.
Centurion: I call on you to protect me.
Yes, of course. It was only a bit of fun, I assure you: I meant no harm. Here.
Don’t touch me, do you hear? The law—
Let me go. Your religion forbids you to strike me.
But I’m convinced already that what you said is quite right. I apologize for striking you.
Yes, yes. There’s a great deal in what you say.
Oh, help me. Mother! mother!
