Awful brutes. If you knew as much about them as I do you wouldn’t want to chaff them. Leave them to the lions.
You didn’t get much out of that. I told you they were brutes.
Certainly, sir. I shall do whatever you think best. Most happy to have made your acquaintance, I’m sure. You may depend on me. Good evening, sir.

I should not, Caesar. He looks a spoilsport. There are men in whose presence it is impossible to have any fun: men who are a sort of walking conscience. He would make us all uncomfortable.
