Ha, the Emperor. Now we shall see. Caesar: I ask you whether it is fair for the Retiarius, instead of making a fair throw of his net at me, to swish it along the ground and throw the dust in my eyes, and then catch me when I’m blinded. If the vestals had not turned up their thumbs I should have been a dead man.
Caesar: is it a dirty trick or is it not?
Let HIM be on his guard. Next time I’ll throw my sword at his heels and strangle him with his own net before he can hop off. You see if I don’t.
