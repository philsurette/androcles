That’s it: strangle me. Kick me. Beat me. Revile me. Our Lord was beaten and reviled. That’s my way to heaven. Every martyr goes to heaven, no matter what he’s done. That is so, isn’t it, brother?
What does it matter? If you die in the arena, you’ll be a martyr; and all martyrs go to heaven, no matter what they have done. That’s so, isn’t it, Ferrovius?
Don’t say that. That’s blasphemy. Don’t say that, I tell you. We shall be saved, no matter WHAT we do.
You’re talking nonsense, woman. I tell you, martyrdom pays all scores.
I never thought of that. O Lord, spare me to be martyred. Oh, what a thought to put into the mind of a brother! Oh, let me be martyred today, now. I shall die in the night and go to hell. You’re a sorcerer: you’ve put death into my mind. Oh, curse you, curse you!
It’s easy for you. You’re strong. Your nerves are all right. But I’m full of disease. I’ve drunk all my nerves away. I shall have the horrors all night.
Yes: I daresay if the truth were known, you’re all as bad as I am.
What’s the good of praying? If we’re martyred we shall go to heaven, shan’t we, whether we pray or not?
Yes: beat me: kick me. I forgive you: mind that.
(sneers)
Nothing.
I never said they didn’t.
They do: they do. Oh, curse you for frightening me!
It’s too dreadful: I’m not fit to die.
Yes, if the people turn down their thumbs.
I thought—
!!! Then is nobody ever killed except us poor—
Oh, Lord! Can’t you stop talking about it? Isn’t it bad enough for us without that?
I can’t bear it. Where’s the altar? I’ll sacrifice.
I’ll repent afterwards. I fully mean to die in the arena I’ll die a martyr and go to heaven; but not this time, not now, not until my nerves are better. Besides, I’m too young: I want to have just one more good time. Oh, will no one tell me where the altar is? .
