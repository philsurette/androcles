Here, you soldiers! clear out of the way for the Emperor.
It’s the menagerie service. My team of oxen is drawing the new lion to the Coliseum. You clear the road.
The menagerie service is the Emperor’s personal retinue. You clear out, I tell you.
Here’s a nice business! Who let that Christian out of here down to the dens when we were changing the lion into the cage next the arena?
Well, the lion’s ate him.
LAVINIA. Oh, poor wretch! FERROVIUS. The apostate has perished. Praise be to God’s justice! ANDROCLES. The poor beast was starving. It couldn’t help itself. THE CHRISTIANS. What! Ate him! How frightful! How terrible! Without a moment to repent! God be merciful to him, a sinner! Oh, I can’t bear to think of it! In the midst of his sin! Horrible, horrible! THE EDITOR. Serve the rotter right! THE GLADIATORS. Just walked into it, he did. He’s martyred all right enough. Good old lion! Old Jock doesn’t like that: look at his face. Devil a better! The Emperor will laugh when he hears of it. I can’t help smiling. Ha ha ha!!!!!
Now his appetite’s taken off, he won’t as much as look at another Christian for a week.
Saved him! Saved him from a lion that I’d just got mad with hunger! a wild one that came out of the forest not four weeks ago! He bolted him before you could say Balbus.
Serve him right! What call had he to walk down the throat of one of my lions before he was asked?
Yes: that’s just like a Christian: think only of yourself! What am I to do? What am I to say to the Emperor when he sees one of my lions coming into the arena half asleep?
Yes: it’s easy for you to talk; but—
Caesar: I must have one Christian for the lion. The people have been promised it; and they will tear the decorations to bits if they are disappointed.
Why not that little Greek chap? He’s not a Christian: he’s a sorcerer.
Caesar: give us this Greek sorcerer to be a slave in the menagerie. He has a way with the beasts.
