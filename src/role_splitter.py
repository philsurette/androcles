"""
Split role recordings into per-line mp3 snippets based on the role blocks.

Assumptions:
- Input recordings live in plays/.../recordings/<ROLE>.mp3 (exclude names starting with "_").
- Output snippets are written to build/audio/<ROLE>/, named <part>_<block>_<elem>.mp3
  where elem counts all bullet lines in the block (directions included) but only
  speech lines (non-directions) are expected in the role recording.
- Snippets are separated by ~2s of silence; adjust thresholds via CLI flags if needed.
